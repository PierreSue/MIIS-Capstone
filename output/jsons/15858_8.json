    "name": "Discrete Differential Geometry - Discrete Differential Form",
    "description": "This course focuses on three-dimensional geometry processing, while simultaneously providing a first course in traditional differential geometry. Our main goal is to show how fundamental geometric concepts (like curvature) can be understood from complementary computational and mathematical points of view. This dual perspective enriches understanding on both sides, and leads to the development of practical algorithms for working with real-world geometric data. Along the way we will revisit important ideas from calculus and linear algebra, putting a strong emphasis on intuitive, visual understanding that complements the more traditional formal, algebraic treatment. The course provides essential mathematical background as well as a large array of real-world examples and applications. It also provides a short survey of recent developments in digital geometry processing and discrete differential geometry. Topics include: curves and surfaces, curvature, connections and parallel transport, exterior algebra, exterior calculus, Stokes' theorem, simplicial homology, de Rham cohomology, Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, conformal mapping, finite element methods, and numerical linear algebra. Applications include: approximation of curvature, curve and surface smoothing, surface parameterization, vector field design, and computation of geodesic distance.",

So, for instance, before we had differential forms now we're going to have discrete differential forms by the way. This parallel structure of language is not always something you have when you move between different disciplines. When you go between mathematics and computer science or physics and engineering. Often what you'll find is that people have come up with different words, different terms for exactly the same idea and concept, and it can take a lot of work to untangle this equivalence and really establish. You know if I'm a physicist. What is the engineer saying if I'm a computer scientist, what is the mathematician saying and so having this kind of parallel structure between these two worlds is actually really powerful because it lets you move very fluidly between talking about continuous mathematics, continuous geometry and translating some deep and rich ideas into algorithms in the other direction. It becomes that much easier to take some tough computational problem. You have and communicate it to somebody who has a mathematical background, so the moral of the story is that by always working hard to find precise translations between different domains, you can open up a whole lot of new possibilities just to review what we did in the continuous setting we introduced. This idea of exterior calculus right, exterior calculus is the calculus of differential forms. We learned to differentiate them and integrate them and so forth as a review. Let's try solving just not using a computer but just using kind of pen and paper a basic equation involving differential forms, so, in particular, let's say we're, given this constant, two form omega equal to dx, wedge d y, let's say we're in two dimensions: okay, and all I want to do is find a one form alpha whose derivative is equal to omega sounds pretty easy, compute the anti-derivative. This is something that you've done, for instance, in your intro calculus class. So how do we do this? What's a good starting point? Well, one thing we could do is we could remember that every one form alpha can be expressed in coordinates as udx plus vdy for some pair of functions? U and v? Okay, so that means the derivative of alpha becomes well the derivative of u wedge, dx, plus the derivative of v, wedge d y. Of course, the derivatives of dx and dy are both zero. Okay and also remember an important fact about the wedge product dx wedge dy is equal to minus dy, wedge dx. If we change the order of the wedge product, we're changing the orientation of our two form, so we can also write omega like this. We could say: omega is minus one half d y, wedge, dx, plus one half dx, wedge d y same thing: okay, so if we want these two things to be equal d alpha and omega, then we kind of know now what? U and v must look like. It must be that d? U is equal to minus one. Half d y and dv is equal to plus one half dx more explicitly. That means you must take the form minus one-half y plus a. Why is that? Well, okay, if we differentiate this function, u we get minus one half d y plus d of a constant which is zero and in fact these are the only functions whose derivative looks like minus one. Half d y, likewise v must look like one half x, plus b for some constant b. Okay. In other words, we know that alpha looks something like this looks like one half x, plus a d y minus y plus b dx for some constants, a and b, so I've plotted. What that looks like for a and b equals zero. Okay, is this what you expected right? We started out with something constant omega is constant and we said what's a thing whose derivative whose exterior derivative is constant, is that the picture you had in mind? I mean, I think it seems kind of unexpected right. Omega is constant, but yet alpha has some kind of interesting, behavior swirling around a point, there's kind of a special point, and yet it doesn't really matter where that center point lives in the plane. If we move this swirling vortex around, we always get this constant to form okay. So the point of this example really is to say that actually solving even very easy.",

                    "Summary": "Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or \"the calculus of infinitesimals\", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.\nIt has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly  devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a  Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for counting (or measuring) a distance travelled by transportation devices in use in ancient Rome, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.",

                    "Summary": "A lecture (from the Greek lecture, meaning reading) is an oral presentation intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a business person’s sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture.  Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content.\nThough lectures are much criticised as a teaching method, universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses.  Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of communication that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon passive learning.  Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning. Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in academia as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.\nLectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on \"keynote addresses\", i.e., lectures. The public lecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements. Union halls, for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. Similarly, churches, community centers, libraries, museums, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. Lectures represent a continuation of oral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. Lectures may be considered a type of grey literature.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, an equation is a statement that asserts the equality of two expressions, which are connected by the equals sign \"=\". The word equation and its cognates in other languages may have subtly different meanings; for example, in French an équation is defined as containing one or more variables, while in English,  any equality is an equation.Solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. The variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called unknowns, and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation. There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variables. A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables.An equation is written as two expressions, connected by an equals sign (\"=\"). The expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the \"left-hand side\" and \"right-hand side\" of the equation. Very often the right-hand side of an equation is assumed to be zero. Assuming this does not reduce the generality, as this can be realized by subtracting the right-hand side from both sides.\nThe most common type of equation is a polynomial equation (commonly called also an algebraic equation) in which the two sides are polynomials.\nThe sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more terms. For example, the equation \n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y=0}\n  has left-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y}\n  , which has four terms, and right-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n  , consisting of just one term. The names of the variables suggest that x and y are unknowns, and that  A, B, and C are parameters, but this is normally fixed by the context (in some contexts, y may be a parameter, or A, B, and C may be ordinary variables).\nAn equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (e.g., grain) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. More generally, an  equation remains in balance if the same operation is performed on its both sides.\nIn Cartesian geometry, equations are used to describe geometric figures. As the equations that are considered, such as implicit equations or parametric equations, have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry, an important area of mathematics.\nAlgebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial equations and, among them, the special case of linear equations. When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form P(x) = 0, where P is a polynomial, and linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters. To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis. Algebra also studies Diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers. The techniques used are different and come from number theory. These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.\nDifferential equations are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives. They are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.\nThe \"=\" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.",

                    "Summary": "Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost. The word engineer (Latin ingeniator) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare (\"to create, generate, contrive, devise\") and ingenium (\"cleverness\"). The foundational qualifications of an engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations. \nThe work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.",

It can be used to separate two objects or portions of an object, lift up an object, or hold an object in place. It functions by converting a force applied to its blunt end into forces perpendicular (normal) to its inclined surfaces.  The mechanical advantage of a wedge is given by the ratio of the length of its slope to its width. Although a short wedge with a wide angle may do a job faster, it requires more force than a long wedge with a narrow angle.\nThe force is applied on a flat, broad surface. This energy is transported to the pointy, sharp end of the wedge, hence the  force is transported.\nThe wedge simply transports energy and collects it to the pointy end, consequently breaking the item. In this way, much pressure is put on a thin area.",

Instead, philosophers engaged in the philosophical study of nature called natural philosophy, a precursor of natural science. Though Thales (circa 624-545 BC) was arguably the first scientist for describing how cosmic events may be seen as natural, not necessarily caused by gods, it was not until the 19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and historian of science William Whewell in 1833.In modern times, many scientists have advanced degrees in an area of science and pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments.",

The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. Cryptography and computer security study the means for secure communication and prevent security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry study the generation of images. Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of computational processes and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.\nThe fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.

The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by Élie Cartan in 1899. It allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of Stokes' theorem, Gauss's theorem, and Green's theorem from vector calculus.\nIf a differential k-form is thought of as measuring the flux through an infinitesimal k-parallelotope at each point of the manifold, then its exterior derivative can be thought of as measuring the net flux through the boundary of a (k + 1)-parallelotope at each point.",

                    "Summary": "A language is a structured system of communication used by humans, based on speech and gesture (spoken language), sign, or often writing. The structure of language is its grammar and the free components are its vocabulary. Many languages, including the most widely-spoken ones, have writing systems that enable sounds or signs to be recorded for later reactivation. Human language is unique among known systems of animal communication in that it is not dependent on a single mode of transmission (sight, sound etc.), it is highly variable between cultures and across time, and affords a much wider range of expression than other systems. It has the properties of productivity and displacement, and relies on social convention and learning. \nEstimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on the arbitrary distinction (dichotomy) between languages and dialect. Natural languages are spoken or signed (or both), but any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for example, in writing, whistling, signing, or braille. In other words, human language is modality-independent, but written or signed language is the way to inscribe or encode the natural human speech or gestures. \nDepending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, \"language\" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings. Oral, manual and tactile languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.\nThe scientific study of language is called linguistics. Critical examinations of languages, such as philosophy of language, the relationships between language and thought, etc., such as how words represent experience, have been debated at least since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greek civilization. Thinkers such as Rousseau (1712 – 1778) have debated that language originated from emotions, while others like Kant (1724 –1804), have held that languages originated from rational and logical thought. Twentieth century philosophers such as Wittgenstein (1889 – 1951) argued that philosophy is really the study of language itself. Major figures in contemporary linguistics of these times include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.\nLanguage is thought to have gradually diverged from earlier primate communication systems when early hominins acquired the ability to form a theory of mind and shared intentionality. This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. Language and culture are codependent. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language has social uses such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as use for social grooming and entertainment.\nLanguages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family; in contrast, a language that has been demonstrated to not have any living or non-living relationship with another language is called a language isolate. There are also many unclassified languages whose relationships have not been established, and spurious languages may have not existed at all. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.",

                    "Summary": "In linguistics, a word of a spoken language can be defined as the smallest sequence of phonemes that can be uttered in isolation with objective or practical meaning. In many languages, words also correspond to sequences of graphemes (\"letters\") in their standard writing systems that are delimited by spaces wider than the normal inter-letter space, or by other graphical conventions. The concept of \"word\" is usually distinguished from that of a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of word which has a meaning, even if it will not stand on its own together or in other small words.\nIn many languages, the notion of what constitutes a \"word\" may be learned as part of learning the writing system. This is the case for the English language, and for most languages that are written with alphabets derived from the ancient Latin or Greek alphabets.\nThere still remains no consensus among linguists about the proper definition of \"word\" in a spoken language that is independent of its writing system, nor about the precise distinction between it and \"morpheme\".  This issue is particularly debated for Chinese and other languages of East Asia, and may be moot for Afro-Asiatic languages.\nIn English orthography, the letter sequences \"rock\", \"god\", \"write\", \"with\", \"the\", \"not\" are considered to be single-morpheme words, whereas \"rocks\", \"ungodliness\", \"typewriter\", and \"cannot\" are words composed of two or more morphemes (\"rock\"+\"s\", \"un\"+\"god\"+\"li\"+\"ness\", \"type\"+\"writ\"+\"er\", and \"can\"+\"not\"). In English and many other languages, the morphemes that make up a word generally include at least one root (such as \"rock\", \"god\", \"type\", \"writ\", \"can\", \"not\") and possibly some affixes (\"-s\", \"un-\", \"-ly\", \"-ness\"). Words with more than one root (\"[type][writ]er\", \"[cow][boy]s\", \"[tele][graph]ically\") are called compound words.\nWords are combined to form other elements of language, such as phrases (\"a red rock\", \"put up with\"), clauses (\"I threw a rock\"), and sentences (\"I threw a rock, but missed\").",

Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.",

                    "Summary": "Geometry (from the Ancient Greek: γεωμετρία; geo- \"earth\", -metron \"measurement\") is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It is concerned with properties of space that are related with distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.\nUntil the 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to Euclidean geometry, which includes the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve, as fundamental concepts.During the 19th century several discoveries enlarged dramatically the scope of geometry. One of the oldest such discoveries is Gauss' Theorema Egregium (\"remarkable theorem\") that asserts roughly that the Gaussian curvature of a surface is independent from any specific embedding in a Euclidean space. This implies that surfaces can be studied intrinsically, that is, as stand-alone spaces, and has been expanded into the theory of manifolds and Riemannian geometry.\nLater in the 19th century, it appeared that geometries without the parallel postulate (non-Euclidean geometries) can be developed without introducing any contradiction. The geometry that underlies general relativity is a famous application of non-Euclidean geometry.\nSince then, the scope of geometry has been greatly expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that depend on the underlying methods—differential geometry, algebraic geometry, computational geometry, algebraic topology, discrete geometry (also known as combinatorial geometry), etc.—or on the properties of Euclidean spaces that are disregarded—projective geometry that consider only alignment of points but not distance and parallelism, affine geometry that omits the concept of angle and distance, finite geometry that omits continuity, and others.\nOriginally developed to model the physical world, geometry has applications in almost all sciences, and also in art, architecture, and other activities that are related to graphics. Geometry also has applications in areas of mathematics that are apparently unrelated. For example, methods of algebraic geometry are fundamental in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that was stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, and remained unsolved for several centuries.",

Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of von Neumann algebras with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions, and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the projections of the hyperfinite type II factor.\n\n",

Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, automated decision-making and other tasks. In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time, and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.",

                    "Summary": "In theoretical computer science, a computational problem is a problem that a computer might be able to solve or a question that a computer may be able to answer. For example, the problem of factoring\n\n\"Given a positive integer n, find a nontrivial prime factor of n.\"is a computational problem. A computational problem can be viewed as a set of instances or cases together with a, possibly empty, set of solutions for every instance/case. For example, in the factoring problem, the instances are the integers n, and solutions are prime numbers p that describe nontrivial prime factors of n.\nComputational problems are one of the main objects of study in theoretical computer science. The field of computational complexity theory attempts to determine the amount of resources (computational complexity) solving a given problem will require and explain why some problems are intractable or undecidable. Computational problems belong to complexity classes that define broadly the resources (e.g. time, space/memory, energy, circuit depth) it takes to compute (solve) them with various abstract machines. For example, the complexity class P for cassical machines, and BQP for quantum machines.\nIt is typical of many problems to represent both instances and solutions by binary strings, namely elements of {0, 1}*. For example, numbers can be represented as binary strings using binary encoding.\n\n",

                    "Summary": "The word day has a number of meanings, depending on the context it is used such as of astronomy, physics, and various calendar systems.   \nAs a term in physics and astronomy it is approximately the period during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis, which takes about 24 hours.  A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times.  Days on other planets are defined similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods, that of Mars being slightly longer and sometimes called a sol.  \nThe unit of measurement \"day\" (symbol d) is defined as 86,400 SI seconds. \nThe second is designated the SI base unit of time. Previously, it was defined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year 1900, but since 1967 the second and so the day are defined by atomic electron transition. \nA civil day is usually 24 hours, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time. Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods, reckoned from one midnight to the next, into which a week, month, or year is divided, and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis. However, its use depends on its context; for example, when people say 'day and night', 'day' will have a different meaning: the interval of light between two successive nights, the time between sunrise and sunset; the time of light between one night and the next.  For clarity when meaning 'day' in that sense, the word \"daytime\" may be used instead, though context and phrasing often makes the meaning clear. The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, \"On which day?\" \nThe biologically determined living patterns (circadian rhythms) of humans and many other species relate to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle.",

                    "Summary": "Mathematics (from Greek: μάθημα, máthēma, 'knowledge, study, learning') includes the study of such topics as numbers (arithmetic and number theory), formulas and related structures (algebra), shapes and spaces in which they are contained (geometry), and quantities and their changes (calculus and analysis). There is no general consensus about its exact scope or epistemological status.Most of mathematical activity consists of discovering and proving (by pure reasoning) properties of abstract objects. These objects are either abstractions from nature (such as natural numbers or \"a line\"), or (in modern mathematics) abstract entities that are defined by their basic properties, called axioms. A proof consists of a succession of applications of some deductive rules to already known results, including previously proved theorems, axioms and (in case of abstraction from nature) some basic properties that are considered as true starting points of the theory under consideration. The result of a proof is called a theorem. Contrary to physical laws, the validity of a theorem (its truth) does not rely on any experimentation but on the correctness of its reasoning (though experimentation is often useful for discovering new theorems of interest).\nMathematics is widely used in science for modeling phenomena. This enables the extraction of quantitative predictions from experimental laws. For example, the movement of planets can be predicted with high accuracy using Newton's law of gravitation combined with mathematical computation. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model for describing the reality. So when some inaccurate predictions arise, it means that the model must be improved or changed, not that the mathematics is wrong. For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury cannot be explained by Newton's law of gravitation, but is accurately explained by Einstein's general relativity. This experimental validation of Einstein's theory shows that Newton's law of gravitation is only an approximation (which still is very accurate in everyday life). \nMathematics is essential in many fields, including natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and social sciences.\nSome areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in direct correlation with their applications, and are often grouped under the name of applied mathematics. Other mathematical areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but practical applications are often discovered later. A fitting example is the problem of integer factorization which goes back to Euclid but had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem (for the security of computer networks).\nMathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. However, the concept of a \"proof\" and its associated \"mathematical rigour\" first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when algebra and infinitesimal calculus were added to arithmetic and geometry as main areas of mathematics. Since then the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries have led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discoveries. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method. This, in turn, gave rise to a dramatic increase in the number of mathematics areas and their fields of applications; a witness of this is the Mathematics Subject Classification, which lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics.\n\n",

                    "Summary": "A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a \"complete\" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for \"full\" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.\nA broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links hundreds of millions of other computers and users.\nEarly computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.\nConventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.",

Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means. \nFor example, \"This sentence contains words.\" accurately describes a linguistic fact, and \"The sun is a star\" accurately describes an astronomical fact. Further, \"Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States\" and \"Abraham Lincoln was assassinated\" both accurately describe historical facts.

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

                    "Summary": "Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text. The English language draws a terminological distinction (which does not exist in every language) between translating (a written text) and interpreting (oral or signed communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of writing within a language community.\nA translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language words, grammar, or syntax into the target-language rendering. On the other hand, such \"spill-overs\" have sometimes imported useful source-language calques and loanwords that have enriched target languages. Translators, including early translators of sacred texts, have helped shape the very languages into which they have translated.Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to automate translation or to mechanically aid the human translator. More recently, the rise of the Internet has fostered a world-wide market for translation services and has facilitated \"language localisation\".",

Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being. The capacity to create and understand the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of human beings. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious reflection, for example, when we talk about the idea of a person or a place. A new or an original idea can often lead to innovation.",

Well then, you can forget about trying to solve these equations by hand. There's no way I'm going to solve for a closed form solution of a differential equation on the bunny and if I want to solve fluid flow or something okay. So the point here is that we really need to use computation if we hope to approximate solutions to interesting, partial differential equations, okay and that's kind of why we want to translate our continuous language into the discrete setting. So how are we going to do it? How are we going to do this translation? Well, as always in discrete differential geometry, we need to say for each object. We have in the continuous setting what is its corresponding analog in the discrete setting. In this case, what we're going to do is replace our domain with a mesh. So if our domain is this bunny rabbit? Okay, we replace that maybe with a simplicial, 3 complex, a manifold simplicial, 3 complex or a tetrahedral mesh, and we are going to work with an oriented, simplicial complex. That's going to be very important, not just an ordinary simplicial complex, we're going to replace this idea of differential forms, which was a fairly complicated idea with just values on this mesh, something very simple. So in particular, a differential k form is going to be encoded by just storing numbers on each oriented k, simplex of our mesh, okay and finally, differential operators like the exterior derivative and the laplacian and so forth, are going to be replaced by sparse matrices, okay by finite dimensional, linear operators. So, for instance, we'll see that the exterior derivative is captured by signed incidence, matrices okay. So, hopefully, in this lecture and the next lecture, a lot of these pieces are going to start coming together right. We talked about meshes and oriented simplicial complexes, and then we talked about all this exterior algebra exterior calculus stuff. We saw these kind of foreshadowing of well orientation, keep showing up k-dimensional subsets keep showing up. What exactly is the connection?

                    "Summary": "Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or \"the calculus of infinitesimals\", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.\nIt has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly  devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a  Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for counting (or measuring) a distance travelled by transportation devices in use in ancient Rome, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.",

                    "Summary": "A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each \"hand\" and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having \"hands\" instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is usually described as having \"hands\" though opposable thumbs are lacking.Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally — for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.The human hand usually has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb; these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers. It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone, the number of which varies among people, 14 of which are the phalanges (proximal, intermediate and distal) of the fingers and thumb. The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist. Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones.\nFingers contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings in the body, and are the richest source of tactile feedback. They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus, the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands. Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs) each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere, so that handedness—the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning.\nAmong humans, the hands play an important function in body language and sign language. Likewise, the ten digits of two hands and the twelve phalanges of four fingers (touchable by the thumb) have given rise to number systems and calculation techniques.",

                    "Summary": "Geometry (from the Ancient Greek: γεωμετρία; geo- \"earth\", -metron \"measurement\") is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It is concerned with properties of space that are related with distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.\nUntil the 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to Euclidean geometry, which includes the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve, as fundamental concepts.During the 19th century several discoveries enlarged dramatically the scope of geometry. One of the oldest such discoveries is Gauss' Theorema Egregium (\"remarkable theorem\") that asserts roughly that the Gaussian curvature of a surface is independent from any specific embedding in a Euclidean space. This implies that surfaces can be studied intrinsically, that is, as stand-alone spaces, and has been expanded into the theory of manifolds and Riemannian geometry.\nLater in the 19th century, it appeared that geometries without the parallel postulate (non-Euclidean geometries) can be developed without introducing any contradiction. The geometry that underlies general relativity is a famous application of non-Euclidean geometry.\nSince then, the scope of geometry has been greatly expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that depend on the underlying methods—differential geometry, algebraic geometry, computational geometry, algebraic topology, discrete geometry (also known as combinatorial geometry), etc.—or on the properties of Euclidean spaces that are disregarded—projective geometry that consider only alignment of points but not distance and parallelism, affine geometry that omits the concept of angle and distance, finite geometry that omits continuity, and others.\nOriginally developed to model the physical world, geometry has applications in almost all sciences, and also in art, architecture, and other activities that are related to graphics. Geometry also has applications in areas of mathematics that are apparently unrelated. For example, methods of algebraic geometry are fundamental in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that was stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, and remained unsolved for several centuries.",

In applications, the functions generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two. Such relations are common; therefore, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, physics, economics, and biology.\nMainly the study of differential equations consists of the study of their solutions (the set of functions that satisfy each equation), and of the properties of their solutions. Only the simplest differential equations are solvable by explicit formulas; however, many properties of solutions of a given differential equation may be determined without computing them exactly.\nOften when a closed-form expression for the solutions is not available, solutions may be approximated numerically using computers. The theory of dynamical systems puts emphasis on qualitative analysis of systems described by differential equations, while many numerical methods have been developed to determine solutions with a given degree of accuracy.",

                    "Summary": "Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text. The English language draws a terminological distinction (which does not exist in every language) between translating (a written text) and interpreting (oral or signed communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of writing within a language community.\nA translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language words, grammar, or syntax into the target-language rendering. On the other hand, such \"spill-overs\" have sometimes imported useful source-language calques and loanwords that have enriched target languages. Translators, including early translators of sacred texts, have helped shape the very languages into which they have translated.Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to automate translation or to mechanically aid the human translator. More recently, the rise of the Internet has fostered a world-wide market for translation services and has facilitated \"language localisation\".",

Foreshadowing often appears at the beginning of a story, or a chapter, and it helps the reader develop expectations about the upcoming events.A writer may implement foreshadowing in many different ways.  Some of these ways include: character dialogues, plot events, and changes in setting. Even the title of a work or a chapter can act as a clue that suggests what is going to happen. Foreshadowing in fiction creates an atmosphere of suspense in a story, so that the readers are interested and want to know more.\nThis literary device is generally used to build anticipation in the minds of readers about what might happen next, thus adding dramatic tension to a story.  Moreover, foreshadowing can make extraordinary and bizarre events appear credible, some events are predicted in order to make the audience feel anticipated for them.Hints may be about future events, character revelations, and plot twists to create mood, convey theme and building suspense, usually to hint the good events that will likely cross paths or happen to the main character later on.Plot can be delayed by situations or events to give the impression that something momentous will occur to build anticipation and emphasize importance to them, giving the audience a series of questions particularly after cliff hangers.\nThis literary device is frequently adapted for use by composers of theatrical music, in the composition of operas, musicals, radio, film, television, gaming, podcast, and internet scores and underscores, and incidental music for spoken theatrical productions.",

A fluid in medicine or biology refers any liquid constituent of the body (body fluid), whereas \"liquid\" is not used in this sense.

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, the exterior product or wedge product of vectors is an algebraic construction used in geometry to study areas, volumes, and their higher-dimensional analogues. The exterior product of two vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  , denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n        ∧\n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u\\wedge v}\n  , is called a bivector and lives in a space called the exterior square, a vector space that is distinct from the original space of vectors.  The magnitude of \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n        ∧\n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u\\wedge v}\n   can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram with sides \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  , which in three dimensions can also be computed using the cross product of the two vectors. More generally, all parallel plane surfaces with the same orientation and area have the same bivector as a measure of their oriented area. Like the cross product, the exterior product is anticommutative, meaning that \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n        ∧\n        v\n        =\n        −\n        (\n        v\n        ∧\n        u\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u\\wedge v=-(v\\wedge u)}\n   for all vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  , but, unlike the cross product, the exterior product is associative.\nWhen regarded in this manner, the exterior product of two vectors is called a 2-blade.  More generally, the exterior product of any number k of vectors can be defined and is sometimes called a k-blade.  It lives in a space known as the k-th exterior power.  The magnitude of the resulting k-blade is the volume of the k-dimensional parallelotope whose edges are the given vectors, just as the magnitude of the scalar triple product of vectors in three dimensions gives the volume of the parallelepiped generated by those vectors.\nThe exterior algebra, or Grassmann algebra after Hermann Grassmann, is the algebraic system whose product is the exterior product.  The exterior algebra provides an algebraic setting in which to answer geometric questions.  For instance, blades have a concrete geometric interpretation, and objects in the exterior algebra can be manipulated according to a set of unambiguous rules. The exterior algebra contains objects that are not only k-blades, but sums of k-blades; such a sum is called a k-vector.  The k-blades, because they are simple products of vectors, are called the simple elements of the algebra.  The rank of any k-vector is defined to be the smallest number of simple elements of which it is a sum.  The exterior product extends to the full exterior algebra, so that it makes sense to multiply any two elements of the algebra.  Equipped with this product, the exterior algebra is an associative algebra, which means that \n  \n    \n      \n        α\n        ∧\n        (\n        β\n        ∧\n        γ\n        )\n        =\n        (\n        α\n        ∧\n        β\n        )\n        ∧\n        γ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha \\wedge (\\beta \\wedge \\gamma )=(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta )\\wedge \\gamma }\n   for any elements \n  \n    \n      \n        α\n        ,\n        β\n        ,\n        γ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha ,\\beta ,\\gamma }\n  .  The k-vectors have degree k, meaning that they are sums of products of k vectors.  When elements of different degrees are multiplied, the degrees add like multiplication of polynomials.  This means that the exterior algebra is a graded algebra.\nThe definition of the exterior algebra makes sense for spaces not just of geometric vectors, but of other vector-like objects such as vector fields or functions.  In full generality, the exterior algebra can be defined for modules over a commutative ring, and for other structures of interest in abstract algebra.  It is one of these more general constructions where the exterior algebra finds one of its most important applications, where it appears as the algebra of differential forms that is fundamental in areas that use differential geometry. The exterior algebra also has many algebraic properties that make it a convenient tool in algebra itself.  The association of the exterior algebra to a vector space is a type of functor on vector spaces, which means that it is compatible in a certain way with linear transformations of vector spaces. The exterior algebra is one example of a bialgebra, meaning that its dual space also possesses a product, and this dual product is compatible with the exterior product. This dual algebra is precisely the algebra of alternating multilinear forms,  and the pairing between the exterior algebra and its dual is given by the interior product.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, an equation is a statement that asserts the equality of two expressions, which are connected by the equals sign \"=\". The word equation and its cognates in other languages may have subtly different meanings; for example, in French an équation is defined as containing one or more variables, while in English,  any equality is an equation.Solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. The variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called unknowns, and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation. There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variables. A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables.An equation is written as two expressions, connected by an equals sign (\"=\"). The expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the \"left-hand side\" and \"right-hand side\" of the equation. Very often the right-hand side of an equation is assumed to be zero. Assuming this does not reduce the generality, as this can be realized by subtracting the right-hand side from both sides.\nThe most common type of equation is a polynomial equation (commonly called also an algebraic equation) in which the two sides are polynomials.\nThe sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more terms. For example, the equation \n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y=0}\n  has left-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y}\n  , which has four terms, and right-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n  , consisting of just one term. The names of the variables suggest that x and y are unknowns, and that  A, B, and C are parameters, but this is normally fixed by the context (in some contexts, y may be a parameter, or A, B, and C may be ordinary variables).\nAn equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (e.g., grain) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. More generally, an  equation remains in balance if the same operation is performed on its both sides.\nIn Cartesian geometry, equations are used to describe geometric figures. As the equations that are considered, such as implicit equations or parametric equations, have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry, an important area of mathematics.\nAlgebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial equations and, among them, the special case of linear equations. When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form P(x) = 0, where P is a polynomial, and linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters. To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis. Algebra also studies Diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers. The techniques used are different and come from number theory. These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.\nDifferential equations are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives. They are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.\nThe \"=\" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation which imposes relations between the various partial derivatives of a multivariable function.\nThe function is often thought of as an \"unknown\" to be solved for, similarly to how x is thought of as an unknown number to be solved for in an algebraic equation like x2 − 3x + 2 = 0. However, it is usually impossible to write down explicit formulas for solutions of partial differential equations. There is, correspondingly, a vast amount of modern mathematical and scientific research on methods to numerically approximate solutions of certain partial differential equations using computers. Partial differential equations also occupy a large sector of pure mathematical research, in which the usual questions are, broadly speaking, on the identification of general qualitative features of solutions of various partial differential equations. Among the many open questions are the existence and smoothness of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, named as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in 2000.\nPartial differential equations are ubiquitous in mathematically-oriented scientific fields, such as physics and engineering. For instance, they are foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics (Schrodinger equation, Pauli equation, etc). They also arise from many purely mathematical considerations, such as differential geometry and the calculus of variations; among other notable applications, they are the fundamental tool in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture from geometric topology.\nPartly due to this variety of sources, there is a wide spectrum of different types of partial differential equations, and methods have been developed for dealing with many of the individual equations which arise. As such, it is usually acknowledged that there is no \"general theory\" of partial differential equations, with specialist knowledge being somewhat divided between several essentially distinct subfields.Ordinary differential equations form a subclass of partial differential equations, corresponding to functions of a single variable. Stochastic partial differential equations and nonlocal equations are, as of 2020, particularly widely studied extensions of the \"PDE\" notion. More classical topics, on which there is still much active research, include elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, fluid mechanics, Boltzmann equations, and dispersive partial differential equations.",

Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, an n-dimensional manifold, or n-manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nOne-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not figure eights. Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, and also the Klein bottle and real projective plane.\nThe concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern mathematical physics because it allows complicated structures to be described in terms of well-understood topological properties of simpler spaces. Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of equations and as graphs of functions. The concept has applications in computer-graphics and augmented-reality given the need to associate pictures with coordinates (e.g. CT scans).\nManifolds can be equipped with additional structure. One important class of manifolds are differentiable manifolds; their differentiable structure allows calculus to be done. A Riemannian metric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. Symplectic manifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in general relativity.\nThe study of manifolds requires working knowledge of calculus and topology.",

The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by Élie Cartan in 1899. It allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of Stokes' theorem, Gauss's theorem, and Green's theorem from vector calculus.\nIf a differential k-form is thought of as measuring the flux through an infinitesimal k-parallelotope at each point of the manifold, then its exterior derivative can be thought of as measuring the net flux through the boundary of a (k + 1)-parallelotope at each point.",

                    "Summary": "A language is a structured system of communication used by humans, based on speech and gesture (spoken language), sign, or often writing. The structure of language is its grammar and the free components are its vocabulary. Many languages, including the most widely-spoken ones, have writing systems that enable sounds or signs to be recorded for later reactivation. Human language is unique among known systems of animal communication in that it is not dependent on a single mode of transmission (sight, sound etc.), it is highly variable between cultures and across time, and affords a much wider range of expression than other systems. It has the properties of productivity and displacement, and relies on social convention and learning. \nEstimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on the arbitrary distinction (dichotomy) between languages and dialect. Natural languages are spoken or signed (or both), but any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for example, in writing, whistling, signing, or braille. In other words, human language is modality-independent, but written or signed language is the way to inscribe or encode the natural human speech or gestures. \nDepending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, \"language\" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings. Oral, manual and tactile languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.\nThe scientific study of language is called linguistics. Critical examinations of languages, such as philosophy of language, the relationships between language and thought, etc., such as how words represent experience, have been debated at least since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greek civilization. Thinkers such as Rousseau (1712 – 1778) have debated that language originated from emotions, while others like Kant (1724 –1804), have held that languages originated from rational and logical thought. Twentieth century philosophers such as Wittgenstein (1889 – 1951) argued that philosophy is really the study of language itself. Major figures in contemporary linguistics of these times include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.\nLanguage is thought to have gradually diverged from earlier primate communication systems when early hominins acquired the ability to form a theory of mind and shared intentionality. This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. Language and culture are codependent. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language has social uses such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as use for social grooming and entertainment.\nLanguages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family; in contrast, a language that has been demonstrated to not have any living or non-living relationship with another language is called a language isolate. There are also many unclassified languages whose relationships have not been established, and spurious languages may have not existed at all. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.",

                    "Summary": "In numerical analysis and scientific computing, a sparse matrix or sparse array is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. There is no strict definition regarding the proportion of zero-value elements for a matrix to qualify as sparse but a common criterion is that the number of non-zero elements is roughly equal to the number of rows or columns. By contrast, if most of the elements are non-zero, the matrix is considered dense. The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., m × n for an m × n matrix) is sometimes referred to as the sparsity of the matrix.\nConceptually, sparsity corresponds to systems with few pairwise interactions. For example, consider a line of balls connected by springs from one to the next: this is a sparse system as only adjacent balls are coupled. By contrast, if the same line of balls were to have springs connecting each ball to all other balls, the system would correspond to a dense matrix. The concept of sparsity is useful in combinatorics and application areas such as network theory and numerical analysis, which typically have a low density of significant data or connections. Large sparse matrices often appear in scientific or engineering applications when solving partial differential equations.\nWhen storing and manipulating sparse matrices on a computer, it is beneficial and often necessary to use specialized algorithms and data structures that take advantage of the sparse structure of the matrix. Specialized computers have been made for sparse matrices, as they are common in the machine learning field. Operations using standard dense-matrix structures and algorithms are slow and inefficient when applied to large sparse matrices as processing and memory are wasted on the zeros. Sparse data is by nature more easily compressed and thus requires significantly less storage. Some very large sparse matrices are infeasible to manipulate using standard dense-matrix algorithms.",

                    "Summary": "A lecture (from the Greek lecture, meaning reading) is an oral presentation intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a business person’s sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture.  Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content.\nThough lectures are much criticised as a teaching method, universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses.  Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of communication that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon passive learning.  Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning. Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in academia as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.\nLectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on \"keynote addresses\", i.e., lectures. The public lecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements. Union halls, for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. Similarly, churches, community centers, libraries, museums, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. Lectures represent a continuation of oral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. Lectures may be considered a type of grey literature.",

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly  devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a  Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for counting (or measuring) a distance travelled by transportation devices in use in ancient Rome, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.",

It can be used to separate two objects or portions of an object, lift up an object, or hold an object in place. It functions by converting a force applied to its blunt end into forces perpendicular (normal) to its inclined surfaces.  The mechanical advantage of a wedge is given by the ratio of the length of its slope to its width. Although a short wedge with a wide angle may do a job faster, it requires more force than a long wedge with a narrow angle.\nThe force is applied on a flat, broad surface. This energy is transported to the pointy, sharp end of the wedge, hence the  force is transported.\nThe wedge simply transports energy and collects it to the pointy end, consequently breaking the item. In this way, much pressure is put on a thin area.",

Quantities can be compared in terms of \"more\", \"less\", or \"equal\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Mass, time, distance, heat, and angular separation are among the familiar examples of quantitative properties.\nQuantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others function as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little.\nUnder the name of multitude comes what is discontinuous and discrete and divisible ultimately into indivisibles, such as: army, fleet, flock, government, company, party, people, mess (military), chorus, crowd, and number; all which are cases of collective nouns. Under the name of magnitude comes what is continuous and unified and divisible only into smaller divisibles, such as: matter, mass, energy, liquid, material—all cases of non-collective nouns.\nAlong with analyzing its nature and classification, the issues of quantity involve such closely related topics as dimensionality, equality, proportion, the measurements of quantities, the units of measurements, number and numbering systems, the types of numbers and their relations to each other as numerical ratios.",

                    "Summary": "Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional region, shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a  three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).\nThe area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size. In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of area is the square metre (written as m2), which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long.  A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares.  In mathematics, the unit square is defined to have area one, and the area of any other shape or surface is a dimensionless real number.\n\nThere are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and circles.  Using these formulas, the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles.  For shapes with curved boundary, calculus is usually required to compute the area.  Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the historical development of calculus.For a solid shape such as a sphere, cone, or cylinder, the area of its boundary surface is called the surface area. Formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes were computed by the ancient Greeks, but computing the surface area of a more complicated shape usually requires multivariable calculus.\nArea plays an important role in modern mathematics.  In addition to its obvious importance in geometry and calculus, area is related to the definition of determinants in linear algebra, and is a basic property of surfaces in differential geometry. In analysis, the area of a subset of the plane is defined using Lebesgue measure, though not every subset is measurable.  In general, area in higher mathematics is seen as a special case of volume for two-dimensional regions.Area can be defined through the use of axioms, defining it as a function of a collection of certain plane figures to the set of real numbers. It can be proved that such a function exists.",

                    "Summary": "A chain is a serial assembly of connected pieces, called links, typically made of metal, with an overall character similar to that of a rope in that it is flexible and curved in compression but linear, rigid, and load-bearing in tension. A chain may consist of two or more links. Chains can be classified by their design, which can be dictated by their use: \n\nThose designed for lifting, such as when used with a hoist; for pulling; or for securing, such as with a bicycle lock, have links that are torus shaped, which make the chain flexible in two dimensions (the fixed third dimension being a chain's length). Small chains serving as jewellery are a mostly decorative analogue of such types.\nThose designed for transferring power in machines have links designed to mesh with the teeth of the sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one dimension. They are known as roller chains, though there are also non-roller chains such as block chain.Two distinct chains can be connected using a quick link, carabiner, shackle, or clevis.\nLoad can be transferred from a chain to another object by a chain stopper",

Informally, any sloping line is called diagonal.  The word diagonal derives from the ancient Greek διαγώνιος diagonios, \"from angle to angle\" (from  διά- dia-, \"through\", \"across\" and γωνία gonia, \"angle\", related to gony \"knee\"); it was used by both Strabo and Euclid to refer to a line connecting two vertices of a rhombus or cuboid, and later adopted into Latin as diagonus (\"slanting line\").\nIn matrix algebra, a diagonal of a square matrix is a set of entries extending from one corner to the farthest corner.\nThere are also other, non-mathematical uses.",

In most systems of measurement a base unit for length is chosen, from which all other units are derived. In the International System of Units (SI) system the base unit for length is the metre.\nLength is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object. However, this is not always the case and may depend on the position the object is in.\nVarious terms for the length of a fixed object are used, and these include height, which is vertical length or vertical extent, and width, breadth or depth. Height is used when there is a base from which vertical measurements can be taken. Width or breadth usually refer to a shorter dimension when length is the longest one. Depth is used for the third dimension of a three dimensional object.Length is the measure of one spatial dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed).",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, a ratio indicates how many times one number contains another. For example, if there are eight oranges and six lemons in a bowl of fruit, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8∶6, which is equivalent to the ratio 4∶3). Similarly, the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6∶8 (or 3∶4) and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8∶14 (or 4∶7).\nThe numbers in a ratio may be quantities of any kind, such as counts of people or objects, or such as measurements of lengths, weights, time, etc. In most contexts, both numbers are restricted to be positive.\nA ratio may be specified either by giving both constituting numbers, written as \"a to b\" or \"a∶b\", or by giving just the value of their quotient a/b. Equal quotients correspond to equal ratios.\nConsequently, a ratio may be considered as an ordered pair of numbers, a fraction with the first number in the numerator and the second in the denominator, or as the value denoted by this fraction. Ratios of counts, given by (non-zero) natural numbers, are rational numbers, and may sometimes be natural numbers. When two quantities are measured with the same unit, as is often the case, their ratio is a dimensionless number. A quotient of two quantities that are measured with different units is called a rate.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm ( (listen)) is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, automated decision-making and other tasks. In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time, and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.",

                    "Summary": "A lecture (from the Greek lecture, meaning reading) is an oral presentation intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a business person’s sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture.  Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content.\nThough lectures are much criticised as a teaching method, universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses.  Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of communication that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon passive learning.  Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning. Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in academia as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.\nLectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on \"keynote addresses\", i.e., lectures. The public lecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements. Union halls, for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. Similarly, churches, community centers, libraries, museums, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. Lectures represent a continuation of oral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. Lectures may be considered a type of grey literature.",

                    "Summary": "The word day has a number of meanings, depending on the context it is used such as of astronomy, physics, and various calendar systems.   \nAs a term in physics and astronomy it is approximately the period during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis, which takes about 24 hours.  A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times.  Days on other planets are defined similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods, that of Mars being slightly longer and sometimes called a sol.  \nThe unit of measurement \"day\" (symbol d) is defined as 86,400 SI seconds. \nThe second is designated the SI base unit of time. Previously, it was defined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year 1900, but since 1967 the second and so the day are defined by atomic electron transition. \nA civil day is usually 24 hours, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time. Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods, reckoned from one midnight to the next, into which a week, month, or year is divided, and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis. However, its use depends on its context; for example, when people say 'day and night', 'day' will have a different meaning: the interval of light between two successive nights, the time between sunrise and sunset; the time of light between one night and the next.  For clarity when meaning 'day' in that sense, the word \"daytime\" may be used instead, though context and phrasing often makes the meaning clear. The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, \"On which day?\" \nThe biologically determined living patterns (circadian rhythms) of humans and many other species relate to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle.",

                    "Summary": "In algebraic topology, simplicial homology is the sequence of homology groups of a simplicial complex. It formalizes the idea of the number of holes of a given dimension in the complex. This generalizes the number of connected components (the case of dimension 0).\nSimplicial homology arose as a way to study topological spaces whose building blocks are n-simplices, the n-dimensional analogs of triangles. This includes a point (0-simplex), a line segment (1-simplex), a triangle (2-simplex) and a tetrahedron (3-simplex). By definition, such a space is homeomorphic to a simplicial complex (more precisely, the geometric realization of an abstract simplicial complex). Such a homeomorphism is referred to as a triangulation of the given space. Many topological spaces of interest can be triangulated, including every smooth manifold (Cairns and Whitehead).: sec.5.3.2 Simplicial homology is defined by a simple recipe for any abstract simplicial complex.

                    "Summary": "Mathematics (from Greek: μάθημα, máthēma, 'knowledge, study, learning') includes the study of such topics as numbers (arithmetic and number theory), formulas and related structures (algebra), shapes and spaces in which they are contained (geometry), and quantities and their changes (calculus and analysis). There is no general consensus about its exact scope or epistemological status.Most of mathematical activity consists of discovering and proving (by pure reasoning) properties of abstract objects. These objects are either abstractions from nature (such as natural numbers or \"a line\"), or (in modern mathematics) abstract entities that are defined by their basic properties, called axioms. A proof consists of a succession of applications of some deductive rules to already known results, including previously proved theorems, axioms and (in case of abstraction from nature) some basic properties that are considered as true starting points of the theory under consideration. The result of a proof is called a theorem. Contrary to physical laws, the validity of a theorem (its truth) does not rely on any experimentation but on the correctness of its reasoning (though experimentation is often useful for discovering new theorems of interest).\nMathematics is widely used in science for modeling phenomena. This enables the extraction of quantitative predictions from experimental laws. For example, the movement of planets can be predicted with high accuracy using Newton's law of gravitation combined with mathematical computation. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model for describing the reality. So when some inaccurate predictions arise, it means that the model must be improved or changed, not that the mathematics is wrong. For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury cannot be explained by Newton's law of gravitation, but is accurately explained by Einstein's general relativity. This experimental validation of Einstein's theory shows that Newton's law of gravitation is only an approximation (which still is very accurate in everyday life). \nMathematics is essential in many fields, including natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and social sciences.\nSome areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in direct correlation with their applications, and are often grouped under the name of applied mathematics. Other mathematical areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but practical applications are often discovered later. A fitting example is the problem of integer factorization which goes back to Euclid but had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem (for the security of computer networks).\nMathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. However, the concept of a \"proof\" and its associated \"mathematical rigour\" first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when algebra and infinitesimal calculus were added to arithmetic and geometry as main areas of mathematics. Since then the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries have led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discoveries. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method. This, in turn, gave rise to a dramatic increase in the number of mathematics areas and their fields of applications; a witness of this is the Mathematics Subject Classification, which lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics.\n\n",

A regular k-simplex may be constructed from a regular (k − 1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length.\nThe standard simplex or probability simplex  is the k - 1 dimensional simplex whose vertices are the k standard unit vectors, or\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          {\n          \n            x\n            ∈\n            \n              \n                R\n              \n              \n                k\n              \n            \n            :\n            \n              x\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n            +\n            ⋯\n            +\n            \n              x\n              \n                k\n                −\n                1\n              \n            \n            =\n            1\n            ,\n            \n              x\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            ≥\n            0\n            \n               for \n            \n            i\n            =\n            0\n            ,\n            …\n            ,\n            k\n            −\n            1\n          \n          }\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left\\{x\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{k}:x_{0}+\\dots +x_{k-1}=1,x_{i}\\geq 0{\\text{ for }}i=0,\\dots ,k-1\\right\\}.}\n  In topology and combinatorics, it is common to “glue together” simplices to form a simplicial complex.

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools.  Early tools, made of such materials as stone, bone, and wood, were used for preparation of food, hunting, manufacture of weapons, and working of materials to produce clothing and useful artifacts. The development of metalworking made additional types of tools possible. Harnessing energy sources such as animal power, wind, or steam, allowed increasingly complex tools to produce an even larger range of items, with the Industrial Revolution marking an marked inflection point in the use of tools. The introduction of automation allowed tools to operate with minimal human supervision, further increasing the productivity of human labor.",

                    "Summary": "Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or \"the calculus of infinitesimals\", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.\nIt has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly  devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a  Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for counting (or measuring) a distance travelled by transportation devices in use in ancient Rome, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, an equation is a statement that asserts the equality of two expressions, which are connected by the equals sign \"=\". The word equation and its cognates in other languages may have subtly different meanings; for example, in French an équation is defined as containing one or more variables, while in English,  any equality is an equation.Solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. The variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called unknowns, and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation. There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variables. A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables.An equation is written as two expressions, connected by an equals sign (\"=\"). The expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the \"left-hand side\" and \"right-hand side\" of the equation. Very often the right-hand side of an equation is assumed to be zero. Assuming this does not reduce the generality, as this can be realized by subtracting the right-hand side from both sides.\nThe most common type of equation is a polynomial equation (commonly called also an algebraic equation) in which the two sides are polynomials.\nThe sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more terms. For example, the equation \n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y=0}\n  has left-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y}\n  , which has four terms, and right-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n  , consisting of just one term. The names of the variables suggest that x and y are unknowns, and that  A, B, and C are parameters, but this is normally fixed by the context (in some contexts, y may be a parameter, or A, B, and C may be ordinary variables).\nAn equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (e.g., grain) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. More generally, an  equation remains in balance if the same operation is performed on its both sides.\nIn Cartesian geometry, equations are used to describe geometric figures. As the equations that are considered, such as implicit equations or parametric equations, have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry, an important area of mathematics.\nAlgebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial equations and, among them, the special case of linear equations. When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form P(x) = 0, where P is a polynomial, and linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters. To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis. Algebra also studies Diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers. The techniques used are different and come from number theory. These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.\nDifferential equations are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives. They are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.\nThe \"=\" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.",

                    "Summary": "Geometry (from the Ancient Greek: γεωμετρία; geo- \"earth\", -metron \"measurement\") is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It is concerned with properties of space that are related with distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.\nUntil the 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to Euclidean geometry, which includes the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve, as fundamental concepts.During the 19th century several discoveries enlarged dramatically the scope of geometry. One of the oldest such discoveries is Gauss' Theorema Egregium (\"remarkable theorem\") that asserts roughly that the Gaussian curvature of a surface is independent from any specific embedding in a Euclidean space. This implies that surfaces can be studied intrinsically, that is, as stand-alone spaces, and has been expanded into the theory of manifolds and Riemannian geometry.\nLater in the 19th century, it appeared that geometries without the parallel postulate (non-Euclidean geometries) can be developed without introducing any contradiction. The geometry that underlies general relativity is a famous application of non-Euclidean geometry.\nSince then, the scope of geometry has been greatly expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that depend on the underlying methods—differential geometry, algebraic geometry, computational geometry, algebraic topology, discrete geometry (also known as combinatorial geometry), etc.—or on the properties of Euclidean spaces that are disregarded—projective geometry that consider only alignment of points but not distance and parallelism, affine geometry that omits the concept of angle and distance, finite geometry that omits continuity, and others.\nOriginally developed to model the physical world, geometry has applications in almost all sciences, and also in art, architecture, and other activities that are related to graphics. Geometry also has applications in areas of mathematics that are apparently unrelated. For example, methods of algebraic geometry are fundamental in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that was stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, and remained unsolved for several centuries.",

Further, the gradient is the zero vector at a point if and only if it is a stationary point (where the derivative vanishes).

The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of complex systems theory.\nScience as of 2010 takes a number of approaches to characterizing complexity; Zayed et al.\nreflect many of these. Neil Johnson states that \"even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity – and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples...\"  Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of \"complexity science\" as \"the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects\".",

More precisely, an n-dimensional manifold, or n-manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nOne-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not figure eights. Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, and also the Klein bottle and real projective plane.\nThe concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern mathematical physics because it allows complicated structures to be described in terms of well-understood topological properties of simpler spaces. Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of equations and as graphs of functions. The concept has applications in computer-graphics and augmented-reality given the need to associate pictures with coordinates (e.g. CT scans).\nManifolds can be equipped with additional structure. One important class of manifolds are differentiable manifolds; their differentiable structure allows calculus to be done. A Riemannian metric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. Symplectic manifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in general relativity.\nThe study of manifolds requires working knowledge of calculus and topology.",

The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by Élie Cartan in 1899. It allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of Stokes' theorem, Gauss's theorem, and Green's theorem from vector calculus.\nIf a differential k-form is thought of as measuring the flux through an infinitesimal k-parallelotope at each point of the manifold, then its exterior derivative can be thought of as measuring the net flux through the boundary of a (k + 1)-parallelotope at each point.",

For example, the propagation medium for wireless communication systems can often be\nmodeled by linear systems.",

                    "Summary": "A building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory. Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures.\nBuildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat (a place of comfort and safety) and the outside (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).\nEver since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings and other structures.",

                    "Summary": "Measurement is the quantification of attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events.  The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. In natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the International vocabulary of metrology published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioural sciences, measurements can have multiple levels, which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales.Measurement is a cornerstone of trade, science, technology and quantitative research in many disciplines. Historically, many measurement systems existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields. Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators. Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern International System of Units (SI). This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. The science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology.\nMeasurement is defined as the process of comparison of an unknown quantity with a known or standard quantity.",

This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers. Dichotomization is the special case of discretization in which the number of discrete classes is 2, which can approximate a continuous variable as a binary variable (creating a dichotomy for modeling purposes, as in binary classification).\nDiscretization is also related to discrete mathematics, and is an important component of granular computing.  In this context, discretization may also refer to modification of variable or category granularity, as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.\nWhenever continuous data is discretized, there is always some amount of discretization error. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered negligible for the modeling purposes at hand.\n The terms discretization  and quantization often have the same denotation but not always identical connotations. (Specifically, the two terms share a semantic field.) The same is true of discretization error and quantization error.\nMathematical methods relating to discretization include the Euler–Maruyama method and the zero-order hold.",

Quantities can be compared in terms of \"more\", \"less\", or \"equal\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Mass, time, distance, heat, and angular separation are among the familiar examples of quantitative properties.\nQuantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others function as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little.\nUnder the name of multitude comes what is discontinuous and discrete and divisible ultimately into indivisibles, such as: army, fleet, flock, government, company, party, people, mess (military), chorus, crowd, and number; all which are cases of collective nouns. Under the name of magnitude comes what is continuous and unified and divisible only into smaller divisibles, such as: matter, mass, energy, liquid, material—all cases of non-collective nouns.\nAlong with analyzing its nature and classification, the issues of quantity involve such closely related topics as dimensionality, equality, proportion, the measurements of quantities, the units of measurements, number and numbering systems, the types of numbers and their relations to each other as numerical ratios.",

It is often required to interpolate; that is, estimate the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable.\nA closely related problem is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function. Suppose the formula for some given function is known, but too complicated to evaluate efficiently. A few data points from the original function can be interpolated to produce a simpler function which is still fairly close to the original. The resulting gain in simplicity may outweigh the loss from interpolation error and give better performance in calculation process.",

                    "Summary": "A calculation is a deliberate process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more results. The term is used in a variety of senses, from the very definite arithmetical calculation of using an algorithm, to the vague heuristics of calculating a strategy in a competition, or calculating the chance of a successful relationship between two people.\nFor example, multiplying 7 by 6 is a simple algorithmic calculation. Estimating the fair price for financial instruments using the Black–Scholes model is a more complex algorithmic calculation.\nStatistical estimations of the likely election results from opinion polls also involve algorithmic calculations, but produces ranges of possibilities rather than exact answers.\nTo calculate means to determine mathematically in the case of a number or amount, or in the case of an abstract problem to deduce the answer using logic, reason or common sense. The English word derives from the Latin calculus, which originally meant a small stone in the gall-bladder (from Latin calx). It also meant a pebble used for calculating, or a small stone used as a counter in an abacus (Latin abacus, Greek abax). The abacus was an instrument used by Greeks and Romans for arithmetic calculations, preceding the slide-rule and the electronic calculator, and consisted of perforated pebbles sliding on iron bars.",

Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\nRights are fundamental to any civilization and the history of social conflicts is often bound up with attempts both to define and to redefine them. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\".",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is an object similar to a line, but that does not have to be straight.\nIntuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point. This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in Euclid's Elements: \"The [curved] line is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width.\"This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function. In some contexts, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization, and the curve is a parametric curve. In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves. This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below). Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations.\nNevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot be drawn. This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves. For ensuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said to be a differentiable curve.\nA plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates. More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one. If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k, the curve is said to be defined over k. In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where k is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves. When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve, which, from the topological point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface. Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied. In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography.",

Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means. \nFor example, \"This sentence contains words.\" accurately describes a linguistic fact, and \"The sun is a star\" accurately describes an astronomical fact. Further, \"Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States\" and \"Abraham Lincoln was assassinated\" both accurately describe historical facts. Generally speaking, facts are independent of belief and of knowledge and opinion.",

                    "Summary": "Information is processed, organised and structured data. It provides context for data and enables decision making. For example, a single customer’s sale at a restaurant is data – this becomes information when the business is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish.More technically, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty; it answers the question of \"What an entity is\" and thus defines both its essence and the nature of its characteristics. The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts. Thus the concept becomes synonymous to notions of constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, proposition, representation, and entropy.\nInformation is associated with data. The difference is that information resolves uncertainty. Data can represent redundant symbols, but approaches information through optimal data compression.\nInformation can be transmitted in time, via data storage, and space, via communication and telecommunication. Information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation. That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, information is always conveyed as the content of a message.\nInformation can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation (for example, information may be encoded into a sequence of signs, or transmitted via a signal). It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication.\nThe uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence. Uncertainty is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. Information theory takes advantage of this fact by concluding that more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty. The bit is a typical unit of information. It is 'that which reduces uncertainty by half'. Other units such as the nat may be used. For example, the information encoded in one \"fair\" coin flip is log2(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log2(4/1) = 2 bits. A 2011 Science article estimated that 97% of technologically stored information was already in digital bits in 2007, and that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age for information storage (with digital storage capacity bypassing analog for the first time).",

It is often required to interpolate; that is, estimate the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable.\nA closely related problem is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function. Suppose the formula for some given function is known, but too complicated to evaluate efficiently. A few data points from the original function can be interpolated to produce a simpler function which is still fairly close to the original. The resulting gain in simplicity may outweigh the loss from interpolation error and give better performance in calculation process.",

This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers. Dichotomization is the special case of discretization in which the number of discrete classes is 2, which can approximate a continuous variable as a binary variable (creating a dichotomy for modeling purposes, as in binary classification).\nDiscretization is also related to discrete mathematics, and is an important component of granular computing.  In this context, discretization may also refer to modification of variable or category granularity, as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.\nWhenever continuous data is discretized, there is always some amount of discretization error. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered negligible for the modeling purposes at hand.\n The terms discretization  and quantization often have the same denotation but not always identical connotations. (Specifically, the two terms share a semantic field.) The same is true of discretization error and quantization error.\nMathematical methods relating to discretization include the Euler–Maruyama method and the zero-order hold.",

To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms k-selection, k-multiset, or k-combination with repetition are often used. If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears.\nAlthough the set of three fruits was small enough to write a complete list of combinations, this becomes impractical as the size of the set increases. For example, a poker hand can be described as a 5-combination (k = 5) of cards from a 52 card deck (n = 52). The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is 1 / 2,598,960.",

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or fictional, without regard to context or scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping. The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables.\nAlthough the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word \"map\" comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world. Thus, \"map\" became a shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.\n\n",

                    "Summary": "The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound. There is usually a resonance head on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way. Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by the one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit.\n\n",

                    "Summary": "Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or \"the calculus of infinitesimals\", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.\nIt has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly  devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a  Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for counting (or measuring) a distance travelled by transportation devices in use in ancient Rome, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.",

                    "Summary": "Measurement is the quantification of attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events.  The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. In natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the International vocabulary of metrology published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioural sciences, measurements can have multiple levels, which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales.Measurement is a cornerstone of trade, science, technology and quantitative research in many disciplines. Historically, many measurement systems existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields. Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators. Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern International System of Units (SI). This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. The science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology.\nMeasurement is defined as the process of comparison of an unknown quantity with a known or standard quantity.",

They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. The entity identified by a name is called its referent. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning as well) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called \"common names\" or (obsolete) \"general names\".

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, and more specifically in linear algebra, a linear map (also called a linear mapping, linear transformation, vector space homomorphism, or in some contexts linear function) is a mapping \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        →\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V\\to W}\n   between two  vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. The same names and the same definition are also used for the more general case of modules over a ring; see Module homomorphism.\nIf a linear map is a bijection then it is called a linear isomorphism. In the case where \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V=W}\n  , a linear map is called a (linear) endomorphism. Sometimes the term linear operator refers to this case, but the term \"linear operator\" can have different meanings for different conventions: for example, it can be used to emphasize that \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W}\n   are real vector spaces (not necessarily with \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V=W}\n  ), or it can be used to emphasize that \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n   is a function space, which is a common convention in functional analysis. Sometimes the term linear function has the same meaning as linear map, while in analysis it does not.\nA linear map from V  to W always maps the origin of V  to the origin of W. Moreover, it maps  linear subspaces in V onto linear subspaces in W (possibly of a lower dimension); for example, it maps a plane through the origin in V to either a plane through the origin in W, a line through the origin in W, or just the origin in W. Linear maps can often be represented as matrices, and simple examples include rotation and reflection linear transformations.\nIn the language of category theory, linear maps are the morphisms of vector spaces.",

Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, automated decision-making and other tasks. In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time, and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.",

Alternatively, as Herbert A. Simon suggests, something is simple or complex depending on the way we choose to describe it. In some uses, the label \"simplicity\" can imply beauty, purity, or clarity. In other cases, the term may suggest a lack of nuance or complexity relative to what is required.\nThe concept of simplicity is related to the field of epistemology and philosophy of science (e.g., in Occam's razor). Religions also reflect on simplicity with concepts such as divine simplicity.

A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        △\n        A\n        B\n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\triangle ABC}\n  .\nIn Euclidean geometry, any three points, when non-collinear, determine a unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane (i.e. a two-dimensional Euclidean space). In other words, there is only one plane that contains that triangle, and every triangle is contained in some plane. If the entire geometry is only the Euclidean plane, there is only one plane and all triangles are contained in it; however, in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, this is no longer true. This article is about triangles in Euclidean geometry, and in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.",

What would you do if you said? Okay, I have this. One form is defined at every single point in the entire plane, or maybe every point inside this rectangular region. How could you capture that differential form with a finite amount of information? What's the most natural thing to do? Okay? Well, I already kind of gave away what we're going to do, but something that's, maybe more natural. The thing that comes to mind first, is to say I don't know why don't I just pick some set of points, some finite set of points and I'll just read off the value of this differential form at each of those points. Okay. Well, certainly, we've succeeded at discretizing the differential form we've taken a continuous object and we now have a finite amount of information, but just discretizing is not enough right. Once we have this finite amount of information, we still need to be able to compute with it. We need to be able to answer questions about it right so, for instance, if we wanted to take the exterior derivative now of this sample data, what would we do? Maybe maybe there's something you could do here, but generally speaking, this discretization doesn't really have enough structure to say much interesting about the original differential form. We can't really do computation on this data, so here's what we're going to do. Instead, we take the same continuous differential form, this one form and we put down a mesh over the domain. Okay. So this is an oriented, simplicial 2 complex, because this is a differential, 1 form. We know that we can integrate it along one-dimensional curves, which curves do we have in this mesh. Well, we have the edges of the mesh, the oriented edges, and so, if we integrate the differential form along each of these edges, we get a number per oriented edge. Okay and that's all a discrete differential one form is it's a number per edge of a mesh or, more generally, we integrate differential k forms over k, simplices to get a discrete differential k form now. Why is that any? Better than doing a point, sampling well we'll see in more detail right that this still doesn't tell us everything about the original differential form, but it is enough to formulate and solve equations. We can do things like take the exterior derivative or take the hodge star, and once we can do that, we're rolling. We can build up those more complicated operators. So, in a little more detail, let's say.",

                    "Summary": "In applied mathematics, discretization is the process of transferring continuous functions, models, variables, and equations into discrete counterparts.  This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers. Dichotomization is the special case of discretization in which the number of discrete classes is 2, which can approximate a continuous variable as a binary variable (creating a dichotomy for modeling purposes, as in binary classification).\nDiscretization is also related to discrete mathematics, and is an important component of granular computing.  In this context, discretization may also refer to modification of variable or category granularity, as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.\nWhenever continuous data is discretized, there is always some amount of discretization error. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered negligible for the modeling purposes at hand.\n The terms discretization  and quantization often have the same denotation but not always identical connotations. (Specifically, the two terms share a semantic field.) The same is true of discretization error and quantization error.\nMathematical methods relating to discretization include the Euler–Maruyama method and the zero-order hold.",

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

                    "Summary": "Information is processed, organised and structured data. It provides context for data and enables decision making. For example, a single customer’s sale at a restaurant is data – this becomes information when the business is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish.More technically, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty; it answers the question of \"What an entity is\" and thus defines both its essence and the nature of its characteristics. The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts. Thus the concept becomes synonymous to notions of constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, proposition, representation, and entropy.\nInformation is associated with data. The difference is that information resolves uncertainty. Data can represent redundant symbols, but approaches information through optimal data compression.\nInformation can be transmitted in time, via data storage, and space, via communication and telecommunication. Information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation. That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, information is always conveyed as the content of a message.\nInformation can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation (for example, information may be encoded into a sequence of signs, or transmitted via a signal). It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication.\nThe uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence. Uncertainty is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. Information theory takes advantage of this fact by concluding that more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty. The bit is a typical unit of information. It is 'that which reduces uncertainty by half'. Other units such as the nat may be used. For example, the information encoded in one \"fair\" coin flip is log2(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log2(4/1) = 2 bits. A 2011 Science article estimated that 97% of technologically stored information was already in digital bits in 2007, and that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age for information storage (with digital storage capacity bypassing analog for the first time).",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, an equation is a statement that asserts the equality of two expressions, which are connected by the equals sign \"=\". The word equation and its cognates in other languages may have subtly different meanings; for example, in French an équation is defined as containing one or more variables, while in English,  any equality is an equation.Solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. The variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called unknowns, and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation. There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variables. A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables.An equation is written as two expressions, connected by an equals sign (\"=\"). The expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the \"left-hand side\" and \"right-hand side\" of the equation. Very often the right-hand side of an equation is assumed to be zero. Assuming this does not reduce the generality, as this can be realized by subtracting the right-hand side from both sides.\nThe most common type of equation is a polynomial equation (commonly called also an algebraic equation) in which the two sides are polynomials.\nThe sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more terms. For example, the equation \n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y=0}\n  has left-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y}\n  , which has four terms, and right-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n  , consisting of just one term. The names of the variables suggest that x and y are unknowns, and that  A, B, and C are parameters, but this is normally fixed by the context (in some contexts, y may be a parameter, or A, B, and C may be ordinary variables).\nAn equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (e.g., grain) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. More generally, an  equation remains in balance if the same operation is performed on its both sides.\nIn Cartesian geometry, equations are used to describe geometric figures. As the equations that are considered, such as implicit equations or parametric equations, have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry, an important area of mathematics.\nAlgebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial equations and, among them, the special case of linear equations. When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form P(x) = 0, where P is a polynomial, and linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters. To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis. Algebra also studies Diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers. The techniques used are different and come from number theory. These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.\nDifferential equations are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives. They are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.\nThe \"=\" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.",

The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by Élie Cartan in 1899. It allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of Stokes' theorem, Gauss's theorem, and Green's theorem from vector calculus.\nIf a differential k-form is thought of as measuring the flux through an infinitesimal k-parallelotope at each point of the manifold, then its exterior derivative can be thought of as measuring the net flux through the boundary of a (k + 1)-parallelotope at each point.",

Questions can thus be understood as a kind of illocutionary act in the field of pragmatics or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics. Questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is an object similar to a line, but that does not have to be straight.\nIntuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point. This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in Euclid's Elements: \"The [curved] line is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width.\"This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function. In some contexts, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization, and the curve is a parametric curve. In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves. This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below). Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations.\nNevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot be drawn. This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves. For ensuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said to be a differentiable curve.\nA plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates. More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one. If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k, the curve is said to be defined over k. In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where k is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves. When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve, which, from the topological point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface. Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied. In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography.",

Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.",

Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\nRights are fundamental to any civilization and the history of social conflicts is often bound up with attempts both to define and to redefine them. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\".",

                    "Summary": "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers. Dichotomization is the special case of discretization in which the number of discrete classes is 2, which can approximate a continuous variable as a binary variable (creating a dichotomy for modeling purposes, as in binary classification).\nDiscretization is also related to discrete mathematics, and is an important component of granular computing.  In this context, discretization may also refer to modification of variable or category granularity, as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.\nWhenever continuous data is discretized, there is always some amount of discretization error. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered negligible for the modeling purposes at hand.\n The terms discretization  and quantization often have the same denotation but not always identical connotations. (Specifically, the two terms share a semantic field.) The same is true of discretization error and quantization error.\nMathematical methods relating to discretization include the Euler–Maruyama method and the zero-order hold.",

Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or fictional, without regard to context or scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping. The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables.\nAlthough the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word \"map\" comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world. Thus, \"map\" became a shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.\n\n",

Possible results include advantage, disadvantage, gain, injury, loss, value and victory. There may be a range of possible outcomes nt depending on the point of view, historical distance or relevance. Reaching no result can mean that actions are inefficient, ineffective, meaningless or flawed.\nSome types of result are as follows:\n\nin general, the outcome of any kind of research, action or phenomenon\nin games (e.g. cricket, lotteries) or wars, the result includes the identity of the victorious party and possibly the effects on the environment\nin mathematics, the final value of a calculation (e.g. arithmetic operation), function or statistical expression, or the final statement of a theorem that has been proven\nin statistics, any information analyzed, extracted or interpolated from polls, tests or logs\nin computer sciences, the return value of a function, state of a system or list of records matching a query (e.g. web search). The result type is the data type of the data returned by a function.\nin science, the outcome of an experiment (e.g. see null hypothesis)\nin forensics and justice, the proof of guilt or innocence of a suspect after evaluating evidence in a criminal investigation\nin economics and accounting, the profit or loss at the end of a fiscal period.\nin democracy,",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, an integral assigns numbers to functions in a way that describes displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data. The process of finding integrals is called integration. Along with differentiation, integration is a fundamental, essential operation of calculus, and serves as a tool to solve problems in mathematics and physics involving the area of an arbitrary shape, the length of a curve, and the volume of a solid, among others.\nThe integrals enumerated here are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function. In this case, they are called indefinite integrals. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known.\nAlthough methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs.\nIntegrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed. For example, a line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting the two endpoints of the interval. In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in three-dimensional space.",

                    "Summary": "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve y = f(x) at a point x = c if the line passes through the point (c, f(c)) on the curve and has slope f'(c), where f' is the derivative of f. A similar definition applies to space curves and curves in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nAs it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet, called the point of tangency, the tangent line is \"going in the same direction\" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.\nThe tangent line to a point on a differentiable curve can also be thought of as a tangent line approximation, the graph of the affine function that best approximates the original function at the given point.Similarly, the tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that \"just touches\" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively generalized; see Tangent space.\nThe word \"tangent\" comes from the Latin tangere, \"to touch\".",

These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly  devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a  Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for counting (or measuring) a distance travelled by transportation devices in use in ancient Rome, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is an object similar to a line, but that does not have to be straight.\nIntuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point. This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in Euclid's Elements: \"The [curved] line is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width.\"This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function. In some contexts, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization, and the curve is a parametric curve. In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves. This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below). Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations.\nNevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot be drawn. This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves. For ensuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said to be a differentiable curve.\nA plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates. More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one. If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k, the curve is said to be defined over k. In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where k is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves. When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve, which, from the topological point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface. Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied. In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography.",

                    "Summary": "Length is a measure of distance. In the International System of Quantities, length is a quantity with dimension distance. In most systems of measurement a base unit for length is chosen, from which all other units are derived. In the International System of Units (SI) system the base unit for length is the metre.\nLength is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object. However, this is not always the case and may depend on the position the object is in.\nVarious terms for the length of a fixed object are used, and these include height, which is vertical length or vertical extent, and width, breadth or depth. Height is used when there is a base from which vertical measurements can be taken. Width or breadth usually refer to a shorter dimension when length is the longest one. Depth is used for the third dimension of a three dimensional object.Length is the measure of one spatial dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed).",

                    "Summary": "A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each \"hand\" and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having \"hands\" instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is usually described as having \"hands\" though opposable thumbs are lacking.Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally — for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.The human hand usually has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb; these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers. It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone, the number of which varies among people, 14 of which are the phalanges (proximal, intermediate and distal) of the fingers and thumb. The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist. Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones.\nFingers contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings in the body, and are the richest source of tactile feedback. They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus, the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands. Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs) each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere, so that handedness—the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning.\nAmong humans, the hands play an important function in body language and sign language. Likewise, the ten digits of two hands and the twelve phalanges of four fingers (touchable by the thumb) have given rise to number systems and calculation techniques.",

It conveys a sense of admiration for good or valuable qualities. It is also the process of honoring someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings.Some people may earn the respect of individuals by assisting others or by playing important social roles. In many cultures, individuals are considered to be worthy of respect until they prove otherwise. Courtesies that show respect may include simple words and phrases like \"Thank you\" in the West or \"Namaste\" in the Indian subcontinent, or simple physical signs like a slight bow, a smile, direct eye contact, or a simple handshake; however, those acts may have very different interpretations, depending on the cultural context.",

The process of finding integrals is called integration. Along with differentiation, integration is a fundamental, essential operation of calculus, and serves as a tool to solve problems in mathematics and physics involving the area of an arbitrary shape, the length of a curve, and the volume of a solid, among others.\nThe integrals enumerated here are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function. In this case, they are called indefinite integrals. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known.\nAlthough methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs.\nIntegrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed. For example, a line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting the two endpoints of the interval. In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in three-dimensional space.",

Two and p one equals three 1.. Okay. So now, let's really try this out. What is the integral of alpha along e? How strongly is alpha flowing along this edge? Well, let's just do this step by step, as we described on the previous slide. So first we can compute the unit tangent along the edge to do that, let's in fact, first compute the length. So we just take the difference of the two endpoints take the norm and find that the length is okay square root of 17. Then we divide the difference: p1 minus p0 over the length and we get 4 1 or 4 minus 1 over root, 17, okay, nothing special about these values. Hence, if we evaluate alpha on t at any point, we get 4, xy plus x, squared over root 17.. How did I get that value? Well, what I did is I applied the one form alpha written at the top of the slide to the vector t. The x component of that vector is 4 over root 17. So I multiply that by x y and the y component of the vector is minus 1 over root 17. So I multiply that by minus x, squared and add them up. Okay. Now we need to integrate. So how do we do that? First, we need to remember: we should integrate with respect to arc length. We should move along the curve at unit speed and add up the values of alpha t. Okay, so this parameterization we can write as p of s, is equal to p naught the first endpoint plus s over length, our parameter divided by the total length of the edge times, p1 minus p0, so p1 minus p0 over l is a unit vector along the edge as s increases. We move along the edge until we get to the full length- l okay, so if we now just plug this in and do an ordinary, integral right, we're going to integrate from zero to l alpha of t at the point p of s right, what is the value of the function for any parameter s if we just make those substitutions, we get an integral 7 over 17, integral from 0 to l, 4s, minus lds and by the time you've worked that out. You find that the answer is 7.. Okay, there's nothing meaningful about the final numerical value here. The point of this is just to see how concretely you would integrate a differential one form over an edge by the way we made a sort of arbitrary choice. Here right we said that t is equal to p1 minus p0 over l. Why not? Let t be p0, minus p 1 over l or what would happen in that case, okay, and that leads to a very, very important concept about.",

The point of this is just to see how concretely you would integrate a differential one form over an edge by the way we made a sort of arbitrary choice. Here right, we said that it is equal to p1 minus p0 over l. Why not? Let it be p0, minus p 1  l or what would happen in that case, okay, and that lead to a very, very important concept about.",

                    "Summary": "In geometry, the tangent line (or simply tangent) to a plane curve at a given point is the straight line that \"just touches\" the curve at that point. Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve y = f(x) at a point x = c if the line passes through the point (c, f(c)) on the curve and has slope f'(c), where f' is the derivative of f. A similar definition applies to space curves and curves in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nAs it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet, called the point of tangency, the tangent line is \"going in the same direction\" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.\nThe tangent line to a point on a differentiable curve can also be thought of as a tangent line approximation, the graph of the affine function that best approximates the original function at the given point.Similarly, the tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that \"just touches\" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively generalized; see Tangent space.\nThe word \"tangent\" comes from the Latin tangere, \"to touch\".",

In most systems of measurement a base unit for length is chosen, from which all other units are derived. In the International System of Units (SI) system the base unit for length is the metre.\nLength is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object. However, this is not always the case and may depend on the position the object is in.\nVarious terms for the length of a fixed object are used, and these include height, which is vertical length or vertical extent, and width, breadth or depth. Height is used when there is a base from which vertical measurements can be taken. Width or breadth usually refer to a shorter dimension when length is the longest one. Depth is used for the third dimension of a three dimensional object.Length is the measure of one spatial dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed).",

The average speed of an object in an interval of time is the distance travelled by the object divided by the duration of the interval; the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the duration of the time interval approaches zero.\nSpeed has the dimensions of distance divided by time. The SI unit of speed is the metre per second (m/s), but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the kilometre per hour (km/h) or, in the US and the UK, miles per hour (mph). For air and marine travel the knot is commonly used.\nThe fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to special relativity, is the speed of light in a vacuum c = 299792458 metres per second (approximately 1079000000 km/h or 671000000 mph). Matter cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept of rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is an object similar to a line, but that does not have to be straight.\nIntuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point. This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in Euclid's Elements: \"The [curved] line is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width.\"This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function. In some contexts, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization, and the curve is a parametric curve. In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves. This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below). Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations.\nNevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot be drawn. This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves. For ensuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said to be a differentiable curve.\nA plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates. More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one. If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k, the curve is said to be defined over k. In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where k is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves. When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve, which, from the topological point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface. Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied. In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography.",

                    "Summary": "Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.\nNevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.Time in physics is operationally defined as \"what a clock reads\".The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in space-time. Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship. Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates). However, the numerical values are different for different observers. In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer. Distance and time are intimately related and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley. General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds. At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities. The SI base unit of time is the second. Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted.\nThe operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is. It does not address why events can happen forward and backward in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum. General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes.\nTemporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms (see below). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (\"time is money\") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans.\nThere are many systems for determining what time it is, including the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time. In general, the numbers obtained from different time systems differ from one another.",

                    "Summary": "Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\nRights are fundamental to any civilization and the history of social conflicts is often bound up with attempts both to define and to redefine them. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\".",

Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means. \nFor example, \"This sentence contains words.\" accurately describes a linguistic fact, and \"The sun is a star\" accurately describes an astronomical fact. Further, \"Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States\" and \"Abraham Lincoln was assassinated\" both accurately describe historical facts. Generally speaking, facts are independent of belief and of knowledge and opinion.",

                    "Summary": "A choice is the range of different things from which a being can choose.  The arrival at a choice may incorporate motivators and models.  For example, a traveler might choose a route for a journey based on the preference of arriving at a given destination at a specified time. The preferred (and therefore chosen) route can then account for information such as the length of each of the possible routes, the amount of fuel in the vehicle, traffic conditions, etc.\nSimple choices might include what to eat for dinner or what to wear on a Saturday morning – choices that have relatively low-impact on the chooser's life overall. More complex choices might involve (for example) what candidate to vote for in an election, what profession to pursue, a life partner, etc. – choices based on multiple influences and having larger ramifications.\nFreedom of choice is generally cherished, whereas a severely limited or artificially restricted choice can lead to discomfort with choosing, and possibly an unsatisfactory outcome. In contrast, a choice with excessively numerous options may lead to confusion, reduced satisfaction, regret of the alternatives not taken, and indifference in an unstructured existence;: 63 \nand the illusion that choosing an object or a course, necessarily leads to the control of that object or course, can cause psychological problems.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, an integral assigns numbers to functions in a way that describes displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data. The process of finding integrals is called integration. Along with differentiation, integration is a fundamental, essential operation of calculus, and serves as a tool to solve problems in mathematics and physics involving the area of an arbitrary shape, the length of a curve, and the volume of a solid, among others.\nThe integrals enumerated here are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function. In this case, they are called indefinite integrals. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known.\nAlthough methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs.\nIntegrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed. For example, a line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting the two endpoints of the interval. In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in three-dimensional space.",

            "transcript": "Integrating differential forms or discretizing differential forms, you know, we've been saying all along. Oh it's very important that we have an oriented, simplicial complex, that if we have an edge we know which way it points. Okay, forgetting differential forms for a moment. Why is it useful in life to keep track of an orientation? Well, one reason is that when you're communicating quantities, sometimes quantities have a natural sign associated with them. So, for instance, if I asked you what is the change in elevation as I go from death valley to mount everest? Well, death valley is a very low point on the earth. Mount everest is very high, and so you might say, oh it's 8 934 meters. Okay, if I ask you the complimentary question, what is the elevation change as I go from mount everest to death valley? Well, a useful answer is to say it's not just that same number, but it's minus 8934 meters. That tells me something very important. I decreased in elevation going from the mountain the to the valley. I increased, going from the valley to the mountain okay, and we can relate this directly to integration or the the fundamental theorem of calculus. So I can think of this quantity on the left as the integral from death valley to mount everest of the infinitesimal change in elevation. As I take each little footstep, am I going up a little bit in elevation or down a little bit in elevation? Likewise, I could think of the quantity on the right as the integral, from b to a from mount everest to death valley of the incremental change. Am I going up or down as I take this path? Okay and what I know is, after taking all those steps from the valley up to the mountain. The final change has to be just the difference between where I ended up and where I started fee of b minus phi of a the elevation at the top of the mountain minus the elevation at the bottom of the valley, okay, well just algebraically, that's the same as minus phi of a minus phi of b. Oh and that's minus the integral on the right. Okay, so really just trying to emphasize this point that when I reverse the direction of an integral, it reverses the sign of the quantity, and this is by the way, a very common source of error. Let's say when you're writing code, you don't properly take into account the orientation of your edge or your simplex, and you get kind of weird garbage results right, very important to keep in mind. Let's look at an example of discretizing a one form over kind of a whole mesh. So in particular let's say we have the unit square is our domain and we have coordinates x y. Let's say that k is this particular oriented, simplicial complex and let's say that omega equal two dx is our differential one form. Okay, how do we discretize omega onto k? Well, we integrate it over each edge so to get omega hat one. The value of our discrete differential one form on the edge e1. We integrate omega our continuous differential form over edge e1. What does that mean? Well, we just need to plug the unit tangent of that edge into omega. The unit. Tangent in this case is just the unit vector in the horizontal direction. Partial partial x, okay, omega is 2 dx, so 2 dx of partial partial dx is just 2, so we integrate 2 from 0 to 1 and guess what we get 2. okay. Similarly, if we want the value of omega-hat 2 the value on edge e2, we integrate omega along e2. We get omega of partial partial y, because omega is just two dx there's no dy component. We just get zero okay and for omega three. We can do it again. We integrate omega along edge three. Now it's a little more interesting. We apply omega to a unit vector pointing to the upper right 1 over root. 2, partial partial x, partial partial y omega, is going to extract the x component of this vector and multiply it by 2.. So we get the integral from 0 to the length of the edge root 2 of 2 over root, 2 dl, which is equal to 2 and so on. Okay, so hopefully this gives a sense of how we start to build up a list of values. We start to build up more and more information about this differential one form by kind of querying it over these different edges question. Why is it that we ended up with the same value for omega hat 1 and omega hat 3.? This seems maybe a little counterintuitive. If we look at these two edges, e1 and e3 e3 looks quite a bit longer than e1. So what what's going on here? Why is the integral not bigger for omega hat three? Okay? Well, if you've been following along you kind of get the idea that omega is not capturing just the length of this edge right, that's not what we're measuring here. What we're measuring here is the extent of that edge along the x direction and since both e1 and e3 go from the left side of the square to the right side of the square, the integral of omega is going to be the same okay, important concept to understand. Let's now think about something even.",

                    "Summary": "Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or \"the calculus of infinitesimals\", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.\nIt has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly  devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a  Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for counting (or measuring) a distance travelled by transportation devices in use in ancient Rome, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.",

                    "Summary": "A valley is an elongated low area often running between hills or mountains, which will typically contain a river or stream running from one end to the other. Most valleys are formed by erosion of the land surface by rivers or streams over a very long period of time. Some valleys are formed through erosion by glacial ice. These glaciers may remain present in valleys in high mountain or polar areas. At lower latitudes and altitudes, these glacially formed valleys may have been created or enlarged during ice ages but now are ice-free and occupied by streams or rivers. In desert areas, valleys may be entirely dry or carry a watercourse only rarely. In areas of limestone bedrock, dry valleys may also result from drainage taking place underground rather than at the surface. Rift valleys arise principally from earth movements, rather than erosion. Many different types of valley are described by geographers, using terms that may be global in use or else applied only locally.\n\n",

                    "Summary": "Quantity or amount is a property that can exist as a multitude or magnitude, which illustrate discontinuity and continuity. Quantities can be compared in terms of \"more\", \"less\", or \"equal\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Mass, time, distance, heat, and angular separation are among the familiar examples of quantitative properties.\nQuantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others function as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little.\nUnder the name of multitude comes what is discontinuous and discrete and divisible ultimately into indivisibles, such as: army, fleet, flock, government, company, party, people, mess (military), chorus, crowd, and number; all which are cases of collective nouns. Under the name of magnitude comes what is continuous and unified and divisible only into smaller divisibles, such as: matter, mass, energy, liquid, material—all cases of non-collective nouns.\nAlong with analyzing its nature and classification, the issues of quantity involve such closely related topics as dimensionality, equality, proportion, the measurements of quantities, the units of measurements, number and numbering systems, the types of numbers and their relations to each other as numerical ratios.",

                    "Summary": "A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.\nHigh elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing.\nThe highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).",

                    "Summary": "Information is processed, organised and structured data. It provides context for data and enables decision making. For example, a single customer’s sale at a restaurant is data – this becomes information when the business is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish.More technically, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty; it answers the question of \"What an entity is\" and thus defines both its essence and the nature of its characteristics. The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts. Thus the concept becomes synonymous to notions of constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, proposition, representation, and entropy.\nInformation is associated with data. The difference is that information resolves uncertainty. Data can represent redundant symbols, but approaches information through optimal data compression.\nInformation can be transmitted in time, via data storage, and space, via communication and telecommunication. Information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation. That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, information is always conveyed as the content of a message.\nInformation can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation (for example, information may be encoded into a sequence of signs, or transmitted via a signal). It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication.\nThe uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence. Uncertainty is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. Information theory takes advantage of this fact by concluding that more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty. The bit is a typical unit of information. It is 'that which reduces uncertainty by half'. Other units such as the nat may be used. For example, the information encoded in one \"fair\" coin flip is log2(2/1) = 1 bit, and in two fair coin flips is log2(4/1) = 2 bits. A 2011 Science article estimated that 97% of technologically stored information was already in digital bits in 2007, and that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age for information storage (with digital storage capacity bypassing analog for the first time).",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, an infinitesimal or infinitesimal number is a quantity that is closer to zero than any standard real number, but that is not zero. The word infinitesimal comes from a 17th-century Modern Latin coinage infinitesimus, which originally referred to the \"infinity-th\" item in a sequence.\nInfinitesimals do not exist in the standard real number system, but they do exist in other number systems, such as the surreal number system and the hyperreal number system, which can be thought of as the real numbers augmented with both infinitesimal and infinite quantities; the augmentations are the reciprocals of one another.\nInfinitesimal numbers were introduced in the development of calculus, in which the derivative was first conceived as a ratio of two infinitesimal quantities. This definition was not rigorously formalized. As calculus developed further, infinitesimals were replaced by limits, which can be calculated using the standard real numbers.\nInfinitesimals regained popularity in the 20th century with Abraham Robinson's development of nonstandard analysis and the hyperreal numbers, which, after centuries of controversy, showed that a formal treatment of infinitesimal calculus was possible. Following this, mathematicians developed surreal numbers, a related formalization of infinite and infinitesimal numbers that includes both hyperreal numbers and ordinal numbers, which is the largest ordered field.\nVladimir Arnold wrote in 1990:\n\nNowadays, when teaching analysis, it is not very popular to talk about infinitesimal quantities. Consequently present-day students are not fully in command of this language. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to have command of it.\nThe crucial insight for making infinitesimals feasible mathematical entities was that they could still retain certain properties such as angle or slope, even if these entities were infinitely small.Infinitesimals are a basic ingredient in calculus as developed by Leibniz, including the law of continuity and the transcendental law of homogeneity. In common speech, an infinitesimal object is an object that is smaller than any feasible measurement, but not zero in size—or, so small that it cannot be distinguished from zero by any available means. Hence, when used as an adjective in mathematics, infinitesimal means infinitely small, smaller than any standard real number. Infinitesimals are often compared to other infinitesimals of similar size, as in examining the derivative of a function. An infinite number infinitesimals are summed to calculate an integral.\nThe concept of infinitesimals was originally introduced around 1670 by either Nicolaus Mercator or Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Archimedes used what eventually came to be known as the method of indivisibles in his work The Method of Mechanical Theorems to find areas of regions and volumes of solids. In his formal published treatises, Archimedes solved the same problem using the method of exhaustion. The 15th century saw the work of Nicholas of Cusa, further developed in the 17th century by Johannes Kepler, in particular calculation of area of a circle by representing the latter as an infinite-sided polygon. Simon Stevin's work on decimal representation of all numbers in the 16th century prepared the ground for the real continuum. Bonaventura Cavalieri's method of indivisibles led to an extension of the results of the classical authors. The method of indivisibles related to geometrical figures as being composed of entities of codimension 1. John Wallis's infinitesimals differed from indivisibles in that he would decompose geometrical figures into infinitely thin building blocks of the same dimension as the figure, preparing the ground for general methods of the integral calculus. He exploited an infinitesimal denoted 1/∞ in area calculations.\nThe use of infinitesimals by Leibniz relied upon heuristic principles, such as the law of continuity: what succeeds for the finite numbers succeeds also for the infinite numbers and vice versa; and the transcendental law of homogeneity that specifies procedures for replacing expressions involving inassignable quantities, by expressions involving only assignable ones. The 18th century saw routine use of infinitesimals by mathematicians such as Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. Augustin-Louis Cauchy exploited infinitesimals both in defining continuity in his Cours d'Analyse, and in defining an early form of a Dirac delta function. As Cantor and Dedekind were developing more abstract versions of Stevin's continuum, Paul du Bois-Reymond wrote a series of papers on infinitesimal-enriched continua based on growth rates of functions. Du Bois-Reymond's work inspired both Émile Borel and Thoralf Skolem. Borel explicitly linked du Bois-Reymond's work to Cauchy's work on rates of growth of infinitesimals. Skolem developed the first non-standard models of arithmetic in 1934. A mathematical implementation of both the law of continuity and infinitesimals was achieved by Abraham Robinson in 1961, who developed nonstandard analysis based on earlier work by Edwin Hewitt in 1948 and Jerzy Łoś in 1955. The hyperreals implement an infinitesimal-enriched continuum and the transfer principle implements Leibniz's law of continuity. The standard part function implements Fermat's adequality.",

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

                    "Summary": "Length is a measure of distance. In the International System of Quantities, length is a quantity with dimension distance. In most systems of measurement a base unit for length is chosen, from which all other units are derived. In the International System of Units (SI) system the base unit for length is the metre.\nLength is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object. However, this is not always the case and may depend on the position the object is in.\nVarious terms for the length of a fixed object are used, and these include height, which is vertical length or vertical extent, and width, breadth or depth. Height is used when there is a base from which vertical measurements can be taken. Width or breadth usually refer to a shorter dimension when length is the longest one. Depth is used for the third dimension of a three dimensional object.Length is the measure of one spatial dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed).",

                    "Summary": "In geometry, the tangent line (or simply tangent) to a plane curve at a given point is the straight line that \"just touches\" the curve at that point. Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve y = f(x) at a point x = c if the line passes through the point (c, f(c)) on the curve and has slope f'(c), where f' is the derivative of f. A similar definition applies to space curves and curves in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nAs it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet, called the point of tangency, the tangent line is \"going in the same direction\" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.\nThe tangent line to a point on a differentiable curve can also be thought of as a tangent line approximation, the graph of the affine function that best approximates the original function at the given point.Similarly, the tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that \"just touches\" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively generalized; see Tangent space.\nThe word \"tangent\" comes from the Latin tangere, \"to touch\".",

                    "Summary": "The word day has a number of meanings, depending on the context it is used such as of astronomy, physics, and various calendar systems.   \nAs a term in physics and astronomy it is approximately the period during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis, which takes about 24 hours.  A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times.  Days on other planets are defined similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods, that of Mars being slightly longer and sometimes called a sol.  \nThe unit of measurement \"day\" (symbol d) is defined as 86,400 SI seconds. \nThe second is designated the SI base unit of time. Previously, it was defined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year 1900, but since 1967 the second and so the day are defined by atomic electron transition. \nA civil day is usually 24 hours, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time. Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods, reckoned from one midnight to the next, into which a week, month, or year is divided, and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis. However, its use depends on its context; for example, when people say 'day and night', 'day' will have a different meaning: the interval of light between two successive nights, the time between sunrise and sunset; the time of light between one night and the next.  For clarity when meaning 'day' in that sense, the word \"daytime\" may be used instead, though context and phrasing often makes the meaning clear. The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, \"On which day?\" \nThe biologically determined living patterns (circadian rhythms) of humans and many other species relate to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle.",

                    "Summary": "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

Questions can thus be understood as a kind of illocutionary act in the field of pragmatics or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics. Questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered.",

                    "Summary": "In electronics, a common-source amplifier is one of three basic single-stage field-effect transistor (FET) amplifier topologies, typically used as a voltage or transconductance amplifier. The easiest way to tell if a FET is common source, common drain, or common gate is to examine where the signal enters and leaves. The remaining terminal is what is known as \"common\". In this example, the signal enters the gate, and exits the drain. The only terminal remaining is the source. This is a common-source FET circuit. The analogous bipolar junction transistor circuit may be viewed as a transconductance amplifier or as a voltage amplifier. (See classification of amplifiers). As a transconductance amplifier, the input voltage is seen as modulating the current going to the load. As a voltage amplifier, input voltage modulates the current flowing through the FET, changing the voltage across the output resistance according to Ohm's law.  However, the FET device's output resistance typically is not high enough for a reasonable transconductance amplifier (ideally infinite), nor low enough for a decent voltage amplifier (ideally zero). Another major drawback is the amplifier's limited high-frequency response. Therefore, in practice the output often is routed through either a voltage follower (common-drain or CD stage), or a current follower (common-gate or CG stage), to obtain more favorable output and frequency characteristics.

                    "Summary": "The mind is the set of faculties responsible for mental phenomena. Often the term is also identified with the phenomena themselves. These faculties include thought, imagination, memory, will and sensation. They are responsible for various mental phenomena, like perception, pain experience, belief, desire, intention and emotion. Various overlapping classifications of mental phenomena have been proposed. Important distinctions group them together according to whether they are sensory, propositional, intentional, conscious or occurrent. Minds were traditionally understood as substances but it is more common in the contemporary perspective to conceive them as properties or capacities possessed by humans and higher animals. Various competing definitions of the exact nature of the mind or mentality have been proposed. Epistemic definitions focus on the privileged epistemic access the subject has to these states. Consciousness-based approaches give primacy to the conscious mind and allow unconscious mental phenomena as part of the mind only to the extent that they stand in the right relation to the conscious mind. According to intentionality-based approaches, the power to refer to objects and to represent the world is the mark of the mental. For behaviorism, whether an entity has a mind only depends on how it behaves in response to external stimuli while functionalism defines mental states in terms of the causal roles they play. Central questions for the study of mind, like whether other entities besides humans have minds or how the relation between body and mind is to be conceived, are strongly influenced by the choice of one's definition.\nMind or mentality is usually contrasted with body, matter or physicality. The issue of the nature of this contrast and specifically the relation between mind and brain is called the mind-body problem. Traditional viewpoints included dualism and idealism, which consider the mind to be non-physical. Modern views often center around physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters. Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10). For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of human-made machines. Different cultural and religious traditions often use different concepts of mind, resulting in different answers to these questions. Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g. panpsychism and animism), to animals and to deities. Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with soul or spirit) to theories concerning both life after death, and cosmological and natural order, for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster, the Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greek, Indian and, later, Islamic and medieval European philosophers.\nPsychologists such as Freud and James, and computer scientists such as Turing developed influential theories about the nature of the mind. The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of artificial intelligence, which works closely in relation with cybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind. The mind is also sometimes portrayed as the stream of consciousness where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.",

How well it is lined up with this two form. The two forms are kind of a little oriented plane at each point.",

                    "Summary": "Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.\nNevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.Time in physics is operationally defined as \"what a clock reads\".The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in space-time. Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship. Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates). However, the numerical values are different for different observers. In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer. Distance and time are intimately related and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley. General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds. At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities. The SI base unit of time is the second. Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted.\nThe operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is. It does not address why events can happen forward and backward in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum. General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes.\nTemporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms (see below). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (\"time is money\") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans.\nThere are many systems for determining what time it is, including the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time. In general, the numbers obtained from different time systems differ from one another.",

                    "Summary": "Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional region, shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a  three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).\nThe area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size. In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of area is the square metre (written as m2), which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long.  A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares.  In mathematics, the unit square is defined to have area one, and the area of any other shape or surface is a dimensionless real number.\n\nThere are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and circles.  Using these formulas, the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles.  For shapes with curved boundary, calculus is usually required to compute the area.  Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the historical development of calculus.For a solid shape such as a sphere, cone, or cylinder, the area of its boundary surface is called the surface area. Formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes were computed by the ancient Greeks, but computing the surface area of a more complicated shape usually requires multivariable calculus.\nArea plays an important role in modern mathematics.  In addition to its obvious importance in geometry and calculus, area is related to the definition of determinants in linear algebra, and is a basic property of surfaces in differential geometry. In analysis, the area of a subset of the plane is defined using Lebesgue measure, though not every subset is measurable.  In general, area in higher mathematics is seen as a special case of volume for two-dimensional regions.Area can be defined through the use of axioms, defining it as a function of a collection of certain plane figures to the set of real numbers. It can be proved that such a function exists.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, particularly linear algebra, an orthonormal basis for an inner product space V with finite dimension is a basis for V whose vectors are orthonormal, that is, they are all unit vectors and orthogonal to each other.  For example, the standard basis for a Euclidean space Rn is an orthonormal basis, where the relevant inner product is the dot product of vectors.  The image of the standard basis under a rotation or reflection (or any orthogonal transformation) is also orthonormal, and every orthonormal basis for Rn arises in this fashion.\nFor a general inner product space V, an orthonormal basis can be used to define normalized orthogonal coordinates on V.  Under these coordinates, the inner product becomes a dot product of vectors.  Thus the presence of an orthonormal basis reduces the study of a finite-dimensional inner product space to the study of Rn under dot product.  Every finite-dimensional inner product space has an orthonormal basis, which may be obtained from an arbitrary basis using the Gram–Schmidt process.\nIn functional analysis, the concept of an orthonormal basis can be generalized to arbitrary (infinite-dimensional) inner product spaces.  Given a pre-Hilbert space H, an orthonormal basis for H is an orthonormal set of vectors with the property that every vector in H can be written as an infinite linear combination of the vectors in the basis.  In this case, the orthonormal basis is sometimes called a Hilbert basis for H.  Note that an orthonormal basis in this sense is not generally a Hamel basis, since infinite linear combinations are required.  Specifically, the linear span of the basis must be dense in H, but it may not be the entire space.\nIf we go on to Hilbert spaces, a non-orthonormal set of vectors having the same linear span as an orthonormal basis may not be a basis at all. For instance, any square-integrable function on the interval [−1, 1] can be expressed (almost everywhere) as an infinite sum of Legendre polynomials (an orthonormal basis), but not necessarily as an infinite sum of the monomials xn.",

Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, a permutation of a set is, loosely speaking, an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order, or if the set is already ordered, a rearrangement of its elements. The word \"permutation\" also refers to the act or process of changing the linear order of an ordered set.Permutations differ from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set regardless of order. For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1, 2, 3}, namely (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), and (3, 2, 1). These are all the possible orderings of this three-element set. Anagrams of words whose letters are different are also permutations: the letters are already ordered in the original word, and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of finite sets is an important topic in the fields of combinatorics and group theory.\nPermutations are used in almost every branch of mathematics, and in many other fields of science. In computer science, they are used for analyzing sorting algorithms; in quantum physics, for describing states of particles; and in biology, for describing RNA sequences. \nThe number of permutations of n distinct objects is n factorial, usually written as n!, which means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\nTechnically, a permutation of a set S is defined as a bijection from S to itself.  That is, it is a function from S to S for which every element occurs exactly once as an image value. This is related to the rearrangement of the elements of S in which each element s is replaced by the corresponding f(s). For example, the permutation (3, 1, 2) mentioned above is described by the function \n  \n    \n      \n        α\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n   defined as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        α\n        (\n        1\n        )\n        =\n        3\n        ,\n        \n        α\n        (\n        2\n        )\n        =\n        1\n        ,\n        \n        α\n        (\n        3\n        )\n        =\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha (1)=3,\\quad \\alpha (2)=1,\\quad \\alpha (3)=2}\n  .The collection of all permutations of a set form a group called the symmetric group of the set. The group operation is the composition (performing two given rearrangements in succession), which results in another rearrangement. As properties of permutations do not depend on the nature of the set elements, it is often the permutations of the set \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        1\n        ,\n        2\n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        n\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}}\n   that are considered for studying permutations. \nIn elementary combinatorics, the k-permutations, or partial permutations, are the ordered arrangements of k distinct elements selected from a set. When k is equal to the size of the set, these are the permutations of the set.",

                    "Summary": "In geometry, the tangent line (or simply tangent) to a plane curve at a given point is the straight line that \"just touches\" the curve at that point. Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve y = f(x) at a point x = c if the line passes through the point (c, f(c)) on the curve and has slope f'(c), where f' is the derivative of f. A similar definition applies to space curves and curves in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nAs it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet, called the point of tangency, the tangent line is \"going in the same direction\" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.\nThe tangent line to a point on a differentiable curve can also be thought of as a tangent line approximation, the graph of the affine function that best approximates the original function at the given point.Similarly, the tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that \"just touches\" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively generalized; see Tangent space.\nThe word \"tangent\" comes from the Latin tangere, \"to touch\".",

                    "Summary": "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

Questions can thus be understood as a kind of illocutionary act in the field of pragmatics or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics. Questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered.",

The process of finding integrals is called integration. Along with differentiation, integration is a fundamental, essential operation of calculus, and serves as a tool to solve problems in mathematics and physics involving the area of an arbitrary shape, the length of a curve, and the volume of a solid, among others.\nThe integrals enumerated here are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function. In this case, they are called indefinite integrals. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known.\nAlthough methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs.\nIntegrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed. For example, a line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting the two endpoints of the interval. In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in three-dimensional space.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, an integral assigns numbers to functions in a way that describes displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data. The process of finding integrals is called integration. Along with differentiation, integration is a fundamental, essential operation of calculus, and serves as a tool to solve problems in mathematics and physics involving the area of an arbitrary shape, the length of a curve, and the volume of a solid, among others.\nThe integrals enumerated here are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function. In this case, they are called indefinite integrals. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known.\nAlthough methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs.\nIntegrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed. For example, a line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting the two endpoints of the interval. In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in three-dimensional space.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, a permutation of a set is, loosely speaking, an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order, or if the set is already ordered, a rearrangement of its elements. The word \"permutation\" also refers to the act or process of changing the linear order of an ordered set.Permutations differ from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set regardless of order. For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1, 2, 3}, namely (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), and (3, 2, 1). These are all the possible orderings of this three-element set. Anagrams of words whose letters are different are also permutations: the letters are already ordered in the original word, and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of finite sets is an important topic in the fields of combinatorics and group theory.\nPermutations are used in almost every branch of mathematics, and in many other fields of science. In computer science, they are used for analyzing sorting algorithms; in quantum physics, for describing states of particles; and in biology, for describing RNA sequences. \nThe number of permutations of n distinct objects is n factorial, usually written as n!, which means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\nTechnically, a permutation of a set S is defined as a bijection from S to itself.  That is, it is a function from S to S for which every element occurs exactly once as an image value. This is related to the rearrangement of the elements of S in which each element s is replaced by the corresponding f(s). For example, the permutation (3, 1, 2) mentioned above is described by the function \n  \n    \n      \n        α\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n   defined as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        α\n        (\n        1\n        )\n        =\n        3\n        ,\n        \n        α\n        (\n        2\n        )\n        =\n        1\n        ,\n        \n        α\n        (\n        3\n        )\n        =\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha (1)=3,\\quad \\alpha (2)=1,\\quad \\alpha (3)=2}\n  .The collection of all permutations of a set form a group called the symmetric group of the set. The group operation is the composition (performing two given rearrangements in succession), which results in another rearrangement. As properties of permutations do not depend on the nature of the set elements, it is often the permutations of the set \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        1\n        ,\n        2\n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        n\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}}\n   that are considered for studying permutations. \nIn elementary combinatorics, the k-permutations, or partial permutations, are the ordered arrangements of k distinct elements selected from a set. When k is equal to the size of the set, these are the permutations of the set.",

                    "Summary": "The second (symbol: s, also abbreviated: sec) is the base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI) (French: Système International d’unités), commonly understood and historically defined as 1⁄86400 of a day – this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours, then to 60 minutes and finally to 60 seconds each. Analog clocks and watches often have sixty tick marks on their faces, representing seconds (and minutes), and a \"second hand\" to mark the passage of time in seconds.  Digital clocks and watches often have a two-digit seconds counter. The second is also part of several other units of measurement like meters per second for speed, meters per second per second for acceleration, and cycles per second for frequency.\n\nAlthough the historical definition of the unit was based on this division of the Earth's rotation cycle, the formal definition in the International System of Units (SI) is a much steadier timekeeper:The second is defined as being equal to the time duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the fundamental unperturbed ground-state of the caesium-133 atom.\nBecause the Earth's rotation varies and is also slowing very slightly, a leap second is added at irregular intervals to clock time to keep clocks in sync with Earth's rotation.\nMultiples of seconds are usually counted in hours and minutes. Fractions of a second are usually counted in tenths or hundredths. In scientific work, small fractions of a second are counted in milliseconds (thousandths), microseconds (millionths), nanoseconds (billionths), and sometimes smaller units of a second. An everyday experience with small fractions of a second is a 1-gigahertz microprocessor which has a cycle time of 1 nanosecond. Camera shutter speeds are often expressed in fractions of a second, such as 1⁄30 second or 1⁄1000 second.\nSexagesimal divisions of the day from a calendar based on astronomical observation have existed since the third millennium BC, though they were not seconds as we know them today. Small divisions of time could not be measured back then, so such divisions were mathematically derived. The first timekeepers that could count seconds accurately were pendulum clocks invented in the 17th century. Starting in the 1950s, atomic clocks became better timekeepers than Earth's rotation, and they continue to set the standard today.",

                    "Summary": "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

A value per oriented edge is a discrete one form and values at faces are discrete two forms: okay, conceptually these values represent integrated k form, but in practice they almost never come from directly integrating a continuous form. So more typically, we might start out with some values at vertices like samples of some function, and then these one forms and two forms and so forth will arise from applying different operators like the discrete exterior derivative to the values at vertices and we're going to talk about those operators in our next lecture.

A value per oriented edge is a discrete one form and values at faces are discrete two forms: okay, conceptually these values represent integrated k form, but in practice they almost never come from directly integrating a continuous form. So more typically, we might start out with some values at vertices like samples of some function, and then these one forms and two forms and so forth will arise from applying different operators like the discrete exterior derivative to the values at the vertices and we're going to talk about those operators in our next lecture.

                    "Summary": "A lecture (from the Greek lecture, meaning reading) is an oral presentation intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a business person’s sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture.  Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content.\nThough lectures are much criticised as a teaching method, universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses.  Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of communication that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon passive learning.  Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning. Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in academia as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.\nLectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on \"keynote addresses\", i.e., lectures. The public lecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements. Union halls, for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. Similarly, churches, community centers, libraries, museums, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. Lectures represent a continuation of oral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. Lectures may be considered a type of grey literature.",

            "transcript": "Orderly way, so one thing we can do is encode a discrete differential k form as a column, vector with one entry for every k simplex in our mesh. So simple example is we have a discrete zero form, meaning a value per vertex. Well, we can encode that as a vector with the same number of entries as the number of vertices to use this representation, we first have to pick some ordering of the vertices assign a unique index between one and number of vertices to each zero simplex or, more generally, to each k. Simplex. The ordering of these indices doesn't matter pick it. However, you like we just need some way to put the elements of the mesh into correspondence with the entries of the vector. One small comment is that you should be careful in a lot of programming. Languages indices might start from zero, rather than one okay, but otherwise the concept's the same so, for instance, a discrete differential one form is a value per edge of an oriented simplicial complex to encode these values in a column vector. We must assign a unique index to each edge of our complex okay and then to build our vector representing the discrete differential form we just go to each edge grab its index grab the value put that value in that entry of the vector.

            "transcript-corrected": "Orderly way, so one thing we can do is encode a discrete differential k form as a column, vector with one entry for every k simplex in our mesh. So simple example is we have a discrete zero form, meaning a value per vertex. Well, we can encode that as a vector with the same number of entries as the number of vertices to use this representation, we first have to pick some ordering of the vertices assign a unique index between one and the number of vertices to each zero simplex or, more generally, to each k. Simplex. The ordering of these indices doesn't matter pick it. However, you like we just need some way to put the elements of the mesh into correspondence with the entries of the vector. One small comment is that you should be careful in a lot of programming. Languages indices might start from zero, rather than one okay, but otherwise the concept's the same, so, for instance, a discrete differential one form is a value per edge of an oriented simplicial complex to encode these values in a column vector.

In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support (the shaft of the column) with a capital and a base or pedestal, which is made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. \nFor the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed \"columns\" because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, \"column\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are engaged, that is to say form part of a wall. A long sequence of columns joined by an entablature is known as a colonnade.",

                    "Summary": "The second (symbol: s, also abbreviated: sec) is the base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI) (French: Système International d’unités), commonly understood and historically defined as 1⁄86400 of a day – this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours, then to 60 minutes and finally to 60 seconds each. Analog clocks and watches often have sixty tick marks on their faces, representing seconds (and minutes), and a \"second hand\" to mark the passage of time in seconds.  Digital clocks and watches often have a two-digit seconds counter. The second is also part of several other units of measurement like meters per second for speed, meters per second per second for acceleration, and cycles per second for frequency.\n\nAlthough the historical definition of the unit was based on this division of the Earth's rotation cycle, the formal definition in the International System of Units (SI) is a much steadier timekeeper:The second is defined as being equal to the time duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the fundamental unperturbed ground-state of the caesium-133 atom.\nBecause the Earth's rotation varies and is also slowing very slightly, a leap second is added at irregular intervals to clock time to keep clocks in sync with Earth's rotation.\nMultiples of seconds are usually counted in hours and minutes. Fractions of a second are usually counted in tenths or hundredths. In scientific work, small fractions of a second are counted in milliseconds (thousandths), microseconds (millionths), nanoseconds (billionths), and sometimes smaller units of a second. An everyday experience with small fractions of a second is a 1-gigahertz microprocessor which has a cycle time of 1 nanosecond. Camera shutter speeds are often expressed in fractions of a second, such as 1⁄30 second or 1⁄1000 second.\nSexagesimal divisions of the day from a calendar based on astronomical observation have existed since the third millennium BC, though they were not seconds as we know them today. Small divisions of time could not be measured back then, so such divisions were mathematically derived. The first timekeepers that could count seconds accurately were pendulum clocks invented in the 17th century. Starting in the 1950s, atomic clocks became better timekeepers than Earth's rotation, and they continue to set the standard today.",

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

                    "Summary": "Measurement is the quantification of attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events.  The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. In natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the International vocabulary of metrology published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioural sciences, measurements can have multiple levels, which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales.Measurement is a cornerstone of trade, science, technology and quantitative research in many disciplines. Historically, many measurement systems existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields. Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators. Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern International System of Units (SI). This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. The science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology.\nMeasurement is defined as the process of comparison of an unknown quantity with a known or standard quantity.",

                    "Summary": "Cocaine (from French: cocaïne, from Spanish: coca, ultimately from Quechua: kúka) is a tropane alkaloid and stimulant drug obtained primarily from the leaves of two coca species native to South America, Erythroxylum coca and Erythroxylum novogranatense. It is most commonly used as a recreational drug and euphoriant. After extraction from coca leaves and further processing into cocaine hydrochloride (powdered cocaine), the drug may be snorted, heated until sublimated and then inhaled, or dissolved and injected into a vein.  Mental effects may include an intense feeling of happiness, sexual arousal, loss of contact with reality, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and dilated pupils. High doses can result in high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes.Cocaine crosses the blood-brain barrier via a proton-coupled organic cation antiporter and (to a much lesser extent) via passive diffusion. Cocaine acts as an indirect sympathomimetic by blocking the dopamine transporter, inhibiting reuptake of dopamine from the synaptic cleft into the pre-synaptic axon terminal; the higher dopamine levels in the synaptic cleft increase dopamine receptor activation in the post-synaptic neuron, which drives the effects of euphoria and arousal. Cocaine also blocks the serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter, inhibiting reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft into the pre-synaptic axon terminal and increasing activation of serotonin receptors and norepinephrine receptors in the post-synaptic neuron, contributing to the modulation of consciousness, emotions, and movements that characterize cocaine exposure.Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. A single dose of cocaine induces tolerance to the drug's effects. After a short period of use, dependence is likely. Abstention from cocaine after chronic use results in  drug withdrawal, with symptoms that may include depression, decreased libido, decreased ability to feel pleasure and subjective fatigue. Cocaine's use increases the overall risk of death and particularly the risk of trauma, and infectious diseases, such as blood infections and AIDS. It also increases risk of stroke, heart attack, cardiac arrhythmia, lung injury (when smoked), and sudden cardiac death. Illicitly sold cocaine is commonly adulterated with local anesthetics, levamisole, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar, which can result in additional toxicity. The Global Burden of Disease study found that cocaine use caused around 7300 deaths in 2007.Globally in 2018, cocaine was used by an estimated 19 million people (0.4% of people aged 18 – 64 years). The highest prevalence of cocaine use was in Australia and New Zealand (2.2%), followed by North America (2.1%), Western and Central Europe (1.4%), Central America (0.7%), and South America (1.0%). Coca leaves have been used by Andean civilizations since ancient times. In ancient Wari culture, Incan culture, through successor cultures in modern indigenous cultures of the Andes mountains, coca leaves are chewed, taken orally in the form of a tea, or alternatively, prepared in a sachet wrapped around alkaline burnt ashes, and held in the mouth against the cheek, and used to combat the effects of cold, hunger, and altitude sickness. Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860. Since 1961, the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime.",

A chain may consist of two or more links. Chains can be classified by their design, which can be dictated by their use: \n\nThose designed for lifting, such as when used with a hoist; for pulling; or for securing, such as with a bicycle lock, have links that are torus shaped, which make the chain flexible in two dimensions (the fixed third dimension being a chain's length). Small chains serving as jewellery are a mostly decorative analogue of such types.\nThose designed for transferring power in machines have links designed to mesh with the teeth of the sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one dimension. They are known as roller chains, though there are also non-roller chains such as block chain.Two distinct chains can be connected using a quick link, carabiner, shackle, or clevis.\nLoad can be transferred from a chain to another object by a chain stopper",

                    "Summary": "A cushion is a soft bag of some ornamental material, usually stuffed with wool, hair, feathers, polyester staple fiber, non-woven material, or even paper torn into fragments. It may be used for sitting or kneeling upon, or to soften the hardness or angularity of a chair or couch. Decorative cushions often have a patterned cover material, and are used as decoration for furniture.\nA cushion is also referred to as a bolster, hassock, headrest, a tush, and a sham.Cushions and rugs can be used temporarily outside to soften a hard ground. They can be placed on sunloungers and used to prevent annoyances from moist grass and biting insects. Some dialects of English use this word to refer to throw pillows as well.\nThe cushion is a very ancient article of furniture; the inventories of the contents of palaces and great houses in the early Middle Ages constantly made mention of them. Cushions were then often of great size, covered with leather, and firm enough to serve as a seat, but the steady tendency of all furniture has been to grow smaller with time. Today, the cushion is considered an upholstery item.",

                    "Summary": "A language is a structured system of communication used by humans, based on speech and gesture (spoken language), sign, or often writing. The structure of language is its grammar and the free components are its vocabulary. Many languages, including the most widely-spoken ones, have writing systems that enable sounds or signs to be recorded for later reactivation. Human language is unique among known systems of animal communication in that it is not dependent on a single mode of transmission (sight, sound etc.), it is highly variable between cultures and across time, and affords a much wider range of expression than other systems. It has the properties of productivity and displacement, and relies on social convention and learning. \nEstimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on the arbitrary distinction (dichotomy) between languages and dialect. Natural languages are spoken or signed (or both), but any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for example, in writing, whistling, signing, or braille. In other words, human language is modality-independent, but written or signed language is the way to inscribe or encode the natural human speech or gestures. \nDepending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, \"language\" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings. Oral, manual and tactile languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.\nThe scientific study of language is called linguistics. Critical examinations of languages, such as philosophy of language, the relationships between language and thought, etc., such as how words represent experience, have been debated at least since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greek civilization. Thinkers such as Rousseau (1712 – 1778) have debated that language originated from emotions, while others like Kant (1724 –1804), have held that languages originated from rational and logical thought. Twentieth century philosophers such as Wittgenstein (1889 – 1951) argued that philosophy is really the study of language itself. Major figures in contemporary linguistics of these times include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.\nLanguage is thought to have gradually diverged from earlier primate communication systems when early hominins acquired the ability to form a theory of mind and shared intentionality. This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. Language and culture are codependent. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language has social uses such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as use for social grooming and entertainment.\nLanguages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family; in contrast, a language that has been demonstrated to not have any living or non-living relationship with another language is called a language isolate. There are also many unclassified languages whose relationships have not been established, and spurious languages may have not existed at all. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.",

                    "Summary": "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

The simplex is so-named because it represents the simplest possible polytope in any given space.\nFor example,\n\na 0-simplex is a point,\na 1-simplex is a line segment,\na 2-simplex is a triangle,\na 3-simplex is a tetrahedron,\na 4-simplex is a 5-cell.Specifically, a k-simplex is a k-dimensional polytope which is the convex hull of its k + 1 vertices.

The associated combinatorial structure is called an abstract simplicial complex, in which context the word “simplex” simply means any finite set of vertices.",

Well, one way we can think about this is we imagine that every simplex, every k, simplex in our complex, is associated with its own basis, vector right so sigma, one sigma, two sigma three. If I'm talking about the the two simplices in this triangle mesh- and you can imagine that I take linear combinations of these simplices. So if I just say okay, my linear combination is zero. I have zero times all of these, you know add them up. Then I'm not specifying any region of the mesh. If I instead take some ssigma three plus sigma, four plus sigma six and so on, okay, we didn't ever define what it means to take a sof simplices. This doesn't make sense in any. You know way that we already understand in this context, in this context of chains, we're simply saying that oh yeah, sigma 3 belongs to this set. Sigma 4 belongs to this set and so forth, okay, but we can be more general about this and take linear combinations that don't just have coefficients of 0 or 1 right, not just in or out so. So what might that mean or what kind of geometric interpretation could you give to such a slet's say I had 2 sigma, 3 plus sigma 4, plus sigma 6., or what, if you had negative coefficients? Well, if these were let's say integers, I could say that kind of means. I have n copies of that simplex. So, for instance, if I have sigma 3, plus 3, sigma 5 plus sigma 8, that might mean I have one copy of sigma 3, one copy of sigma, 8 and 3 copies of sigma 5 or if I have a minus sign. If I had minus sigma 3, that would mean I'm reversing the orientation. So I'm really taking linear combinations of oriented k, simplicities, okay, so hopefully that that description is good enough. If you want to be more formal about it, and you know a little bit of algebra, you can say the chain group ck is the free, abelian group generated by the case implices. If that doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry. You probably have the right idea already, okay. Why is it useful to think about.",

To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms k-selection, k-multiset, or k-combination with repetition are often used. If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears.\nAlthough the set of three fruits was small enough to write a complete list of combinations, this becomes impractical as the size of the set increases. For example, a poker hand can be described as a 5-combination (k = 5) of cards from a 52 card deck (n = 52). The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is 1 / 2,598,960.",

When variables appear in the coefficients, they are often called parameters, and must be clearly distinguished from those representing other variables in an expression.  \nFor example, \n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        −\n        x\n        +\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2x^{2}-x+3}\n  ,  has the real coefficients 2, -1, and 3 respectively, and \n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        b\n        x\n        +\n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c}\n  ,  has coefficient parameters a, b, and c respectively assuming x is the variable of the equation.  \nThe constant coefficient is the coefficient not attached to variables in an expression. For example, the constant coefficients of the expressions above are the real coefficient 3 and the parameter represented by c. \nSimilarly, the coefficient attached to the highest multiplicity of the variable in a polynomial is referred to as the leading coefficient. For example in the expressions above, the leading coefficients are 2 and the parameter represented by a.\nThe binomial coefficients occur in the expanded form of \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        +\n        y\n        \n          )\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x+y)^{n}}\n  , and are tabulated in Pascal's triangle.\n\n",

Alternatively, as Herbert A. Simon suggests, something is simple or complex depending on the way we choose to describe it. In some uses, the label \"simplicity\" can imply beauty, purity, or clarity. In other cases, the term may suggest a lack of nuance or complexity relative to what is required.\nThe concept of simplicity is related to the field of epistemology and philosophy of science (e.g., in Occam's razor). Religions also reflect on simplicity with concepts such as divine simplicity. In human lifestyles, simplicity can denote freedom from excessive possessions or distractions, such as having a simple living style.",

Description is one of four rhetorical modes (also known as modes of discourse), along with exposition, argumentation, and narration.  In practice it would be difficult to write literature that drew on just one of the four basic modes.",

A chain may consist of two or more links. Chains can be classified by their design, which can be dictated by their use: \n\nThose designed for lifting, such as when used with a hoist; for pulling; or for securing, such as with a bicycle lock, have links that are torus shaped, which make the chain flexible in two dimensions (the fixed third dimension being a chain's length). Small chains serving as jewellery are a mostly decorative analogue of such types.\nThose designed for transferring power in machines have links designed to mesh with the teeth of the sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one dimension. They are known as roller chains, though there are also non-roller chains such as block chain.Two distinct chains can be connected using a quick link, carabiner, shackle, or clevis.\nLoad can be transferred from a chain to another object by a chain stopper",

                    "Summary": "Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.\nNevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.Time in physics is operationally defined as \"what a clock reads\".The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in space-time. Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship. Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates). However, the numerical values are different for different observers. In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer. Distance and time are intimately related and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley. General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds. At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities. The SI base unit of time is the second. Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted.\nThe operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is. It does not address why events can happen forward and backward in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum. General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes.\nTemporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms (see below). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (\"time is money\") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans.\nThere are many systems for determining what time it is, including the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time. In general, the numbers obtained from different time systems differ from one another.",

That is, the group operation is commutative. With addition as an operation, the integers and the real numbers form abelian groups, and the concept of an abelian group may be viewed as a generalization of these examples. Abelian groups are named after early 19th century mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.The concept of an abelian group underlies many fundamental algebraic structures, such as fields, rings, vector spaces, and algebras. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their non-abelian counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood and fully classified.",

                    "Summary": "A triangle mesh is a type of polygon mesh in computer graphics.  It comprises a set of triangles (typically in three dimensions) that are connected by their common edges or corners.\nMany graphics software packages and hardware devices can operate more efficiently on triangles that are grouped into meshes than on a similar number of triangles that are presented individually.  This is typically because computer graphics do operations on the vertices at the corners of triangles.  With individual triangles, the system has to operate on three vertices for every triangle.  In a large mesh, there could be eight or more triangles meeting at a single vertex - by processing those vertices just once, it is possible to do a fraction of the work and achieve an identical effect.\nIn many computer graphics applications it is necessary to manage a mesh of triangles. The mesh components are vertices, edges, and triangles. An application might require knowledge of the various connections between the mesh components. These connections can be managed independently of the actual vertex positions. This document describes a simple data structure that is convenient for managing the connections. This is not the only possible data structure. Many other types exist and have support for various queries about meshes.",

            "transcript": "Chains in this way, why is it useful to think about this kind of arithmetic on simplices? Well, here's a kind of nice example. Let's say I start out with a loop c1 and I can write c1 in this way, or I can say: c1 is e3: minus e12, plus e18 minus e15, plus e6 minus e1. Why, by the way, am I not just adding up all the edges in c1? Why am I adding some and subtracting others? Well, if you look carefully at this diagram, you notice that some of the black arrows are pointing one way. Some of them are pointing another way, but I want the loop to go around in one consistent direction. I want it to go around counterclockwise in this case. Okay, I can write another loop in the same way. Let's say: c2 is e15 plus e19 minus c17, minus e8, minus e2, minus e6, okay, and so far I haven't done anything new, I'm using chains to specify regions of the mesh. Now here's the kind of interesting part. I can certainly imagine algebraically adding these two expressions right. I can go ahead and write c1 plus c2, and it's pretty straightforward what that should mean okay and take all the terms in c1 and add all the terms in c2 and what happens so. I notice, for instance, I have plus e15 and minus e15, so those cancel I have plus e6 and minus c6. So those cancel okay. So I get this simpler chain which I guess I could call c3. What does it mean? What was the point geometrically? Well, we can just draw the picture of the chain and what we see is that these two loops kind of got fused together right. I took the sof these two loops where they meet, they have opposite orientations, and so those edges cancel and we get this one bigger loop made out of the two smaller ones. So this whole setup of chains is going to. Let us translate ideas and things we want to do with with geometry or topology into statements about linear algebra and we'll see that a lot more later on in the course, especially when we talk about things like simplicial, homology, okay, but for now, let's just talk about something very basic, which is the boundary of a simplex okay. So let's say we have an oriented k, simplex sigma with vertices vi 0 through vik. What is its boundary? Well, its boundary is going to be an oriented k minus 1 chain. So it's going to be a collection of simplices one degree lower. In particular, it's going to be all the simplicities we get by considering subsets of size k minus one. So this strikethrough means that we've omitted one of the vertices okay and it's kind of an alternating swe raise minus one to the p power. Okay, maybe a little abstract, but this is actually really straightforward idea. So, let's look at an example. Let's say we have a two simplex sigma with vertices v0 v1 v3. Okay, what is its boundary? Its boundary is the one chain- v0 v1, plus v1, v3, plus v3 v0, okay, so here I've swapped the indices around, so that there are no minus signs but geometrically. What does this mean? It just means we get the three edges going around triangle: sigma oriented the same way as sigma okay and that's what this minus 1 to the p takes care of. Another example is, let's say we have the one simplex e, just the edge between v0 and v1. What is its boundary? Okay, we kind of know that the boundary of an edge is the two endpoints, and indeed, if we follow through the definition, we get that the boundary is the zero chain. Boundary of e is v one minus v, zero right, so the minus sign here indicates that we go from v zero to v one and not the other way around. Okay final example: let's consider the zero simplex v1. What is its boundary? Well, according to this definition, it would just be the empty set okay, so everything works out exactly as we'd expect. The boundary operator can be applied not only to individual simplicities, but we can also apply it to a whole chain. If we want the boundary of a region, we can use this kind of linear algebra and manipulate these. These symbols to figure out what the boundary looks like okay, so we have the boundary of the sof, a bunch of simplices or the weighted sof. A bunch of simplices is just the sof, the linear combination of the boundaries, okay, so the boundary operator is kind of linear. In this way example, let's say we have a region on this oriented simplicial two complex: that's just these two triangles sigma one and sigma, two: okay. What does the boundary look like? Well, the boundary of sigma 1 is e1, plus e4, plus e3. Those edges go around the same way that sigma 1 is oriented, and then we add e6, plus e7 minus e4, and so, when we simplify this expression, we just get e1 plus e6, plus c7 plus e3, as we expect, we get a loop that goes around the sort of union of those two triangles. Okay. What? If we now take the boundary of this loop, what's going to happen well, let's just do it one edge at a time, so we can say the boundary of one of these edges is v1 minus v0 and then on the next edge we have v4 minus v1, the next edge. The boundary is v3 minus v4 and the boundary. The next edge is v0 minus v3. So when we add all of these up, we get what what do we get? We get nothing right. We have pairs of terms that cancel. We just get the empty set. Okay, that's kind of what we expect. What would be the boundary points of a loop, there's no endpoint to the loop and what we notice is this idea we had before in the continuous setting the boundary the boundary is always empty. We can make really precise using these kind of linear equations right or this this group operation, okay. Finally, we can go kind of in the.",

A regular k-simplex may be constructed from a regular (k − 1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length.\nThe standard simplex or probability simplex  is the k - 1 dimensional simplex whose vertices are the k standard unit vectors, or\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          {\n          \n            x\n            ∈\n            \n              \n                R\n              \n              \n                k\n              \n            \n            :\n            \n              x\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n            +\n            ⋯\n            +\n            \n              x\n              \n                k\n                −\n                1\n              \n            \n            =\n            1\n            ,\n            \n              x\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            ≥\n            0\n            \n               for \n            \n            i\n            =\n            0\n            ,\n            …\n            ,\n            k\n            −\n            1\n          \n          }\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left\\{x\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{k}:x_{0}+\\dots +x_{k-1}=1,x_{i}\\geq 0{\\text{ for }}i=0,\\dots ,k-1\\right\\}.}\n  In topology and combinatorics, it is common to “glue together” simplices to form a simplicial complex.  The associated combinatorial structure is called an abstract simplicial complex, in which context the word “simplex” simply means any finite set of vertices.",

                    "Summary": "In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law.\nApart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet. The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features.\nAs a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms.  For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental geography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on.  The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional geography.\nIn the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography.\nA region has its own nature that could not be moved. The first nature is its natural environment (landform, climate, etc.). The second nature is its physical elements complex that was built by people in the past. The third nature is its socio-cultural context that could not be replaced by new immigrants.",

                    "Summary": "Simplicity is the state or quality of being simple. Something easy to understand or explain seems simple, in contrast to something complicated. Alternatively, as Herbert A. Simon suggests, something is simple or complex depending on the way we choose to describe it. In some uses, the label \"simplicity\" can imply beauty, purity, or clarity. In other cases, the term may suggest a lack of nuance or complexity relative to what is required.\nThe concept of simplicity is related to the field of epistemology and philosophy of science (e.g., in Occam's razor). Religions also reflect on simplicity with concepts such as divine simplicity. In human lifestyles, simplicity can denote freedom from excessive possessions or distractions, such as having a simple living style.",

Often, the term linear equation refers implicitly to this particular case, in which the variable is sensibly called the unknown.\nIn the case of two variables, each solution may be interpreted as the Cartesian coordinates of a point of the Euclidean plane. The solutions of a linear equation form a line in the Euclidean plane, and, conversely, every line can be viewed as the set of all solutions of a linear equation in two variables. This is the origin of the term linear for describing this type of equations. More generally, the solutions of a linear equation in n variables form a hyperplane (a subspace of dimension n − 1) in the Euclidean space of dimension n.\nLinear equations occur frequently in all mathematics and their applications in physics and engineering, partly because non-linear systems are often well approximated by linear equations.\nThis article considers the case of a single equation with coefficients from the field of real numbers, for which one studies the real solutions. All of its content applies to complex solutions and, more generally, for linear equations with coefficients and solutions in any field.

Euclidean spaces, and, more generally, metric spaces are examples of a topological space, as any distance or metric defines a topology. The deformations that are considered in topology are homeomorphisms and homotopies. A property that is invariant under such deformations is a topological property. Basic examples of topological properties are: the dimension, which allows distinguishing between a line and a surface; compactness, which allows distinguishing between a line and a circle; connectedness, which allows distinguishing a circle from two non-intersecting circles.\nThe ideas underlying topology go back to Gottfried Leibniz, who in the 17th century envisioned the geometria situs and analysis situs. Leonhard Euler's Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem and polyhedron formula are arguably the field's first theorems. The term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century, although it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, an equation is a statement that asserts the equality of two expressions, which are connected by the equals sign \"=\". The word equation and its cognates in other languages may have subtly different meanings; for example, in French an équation is defined as containing one or more variables, while in English,  any equality is an equation.Solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. The variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called unknowns, and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation. There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variables. A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables.An equation is written as two expressions, connected by an equals sign (\"=\"). The expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the \"left-hand side\" and \"right-hand side\" of the equation. Very often the right-hand side of an equation is assumed to be zero. Assuming this does not reduce the generality, as this can be realized by subtracting the right-hand side from both sides.\nThe most common type of equation is a polynomial equation (commonly called also an algebraic equation) in which the two sides are polynomials.\nThe sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more terms. For example, the equation \n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y=0}\n  has left-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y}\n  , which has four terms, and right-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n  , consisting of just one term. The names of the variables suggest that x and y are unknowns, and that  A, B, and C are parameters, but this is normally fixed by the context (in some contexts, y may be a parameter, or A, B, and C may be ordinary variables).\nAn equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (e.g., grain) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. More generally, an  equation remains in balance if the same operation is performed on its both sides.\nIn Cartesian geometry, equations are used to describe geometric figures. As the equations that are considered, such as implicit equations or parametric equations, have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry, an important area of mathematics.\nAlgebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial equations and, among them, the special case of linear equations. When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form P(x) = 0, where P is a polynomial, and linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters. To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis. Algebra also studies Diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers. The techniques used are different and come from number theory. These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.\nDifferential equations are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives. They are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.\nThe \"=\" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.",

If the entire geometry is only the Euclidean plane, there is only one plane and all triangles are contained in it; however, in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, this is no longer true.

More specifically, geometrical size (or spatial size) can refer to linear dimensions (length, width, height, diameter, perimeter), area, or volume. Size can also be measured in terms of mass, especially when assuming a density range.\n\nIn mathematical terms, \"size is a concept abstracted from the process of measuring by comparing a longer to a shorter\". Size is determined by the process of comparing or measuring objects, which results in the determination of the magnitude of a quantity, such as length or mass, relative to a unit of measurement. Such a magnitude is usually expressed as a numerical value of units on a previously established spatial scale, such as meters or inches.\nThe sizes with which humans tend to be most familiar are body dimensions (measures of anthropometry), which include measures such as human height and human body weight. These measures can, in the aggregate, allow the generation of commercially useful distributions of products that accommodate expected body sizes, as with the creation of clothing sizes and shoe sizes, and with the standardization of door frame dimensions, ceiling heights, and bed sizes. The human experience of size can lead to a psychological tendency towards size bias, wherein the relative importance or perceived complexity of organisms and other objects is judged based on their size relative to humans, and particularly whether this size makes them easy to observe without aid.",

To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms k-selection, k-multiset, or k-combination with repetition are often used. If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears.\nAlthough the set of three fruits was small enough to write a complete list of combinations, this becomes impractical as the size of the set increases. For example, a poker hand can be described as a 5-combination (k = 5) of cards from a 52 card deck (n = 52). The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is 1 / 2,598,960.",

One of the many memorable feats accomplished by the Black Arrows was the execution of a world record loop of 22 Hawker Hunters in formation at the Society of British Aircraft Constructors' show at Farnborough in 1958. This was a world record for the greatest number of aircraft looped in formation, and remains unbroken to this day. After the loop the Black Arrows performed the world's first 16 aircraft barrel roll. Roger Topp handed over the lead of the Black Arrows to Squadron Leader Peter Latham in late 1958. Latham expanded the size of the team to nine aircraft from the original five and led the Squadron for two years.\nNo. 111 Squadron were formed at RAF North Weald where they received the Hunter before moving to RAF Wattisham in Suffolk. Until 1961, the Black Arrows were the RAF's premier team. In the early years of the 1960s the \"Blue Diamonds\" of No. 92 Squadron RAF (also flying Hunters), \"The Tigers\" of No. 74 Squadron RAF, equipped with the new English Electric Lightning, the \"Red Pelicans\" flying BAC Jet Provosts, and the \"Yellowjacks\" flying Folland Gnats formed. The large number of squadron display teams later rationalised to a single unit from the Central Flying School.",

                    "Summary": "The self is an individual person as the object of its own reflective consciousness. Since the self is a reference by a subject to the same subject, this reference is necessarily subjective. The sense of having a self—or selfhood—should, however, not be confused with subjectivity itself. Ostensibly, this sense is directed outward from the subject to refer inward, back to its \"self\" (or itself). Examples of psychiatric conditions where such \"sameness\" may become broken include depersonalization, which sometimes occurs in schizophrenia: the self appears different from the subject.\nThe first-person perspective distinguishes selfhood from personal identity. Whereas \"identity\" is (literally) sameness and may involve categorization and labeling,\nselfhood implies a first-person perspective and suggests potential uniqueness. Conversely, we use \"person\" as a third-person reference. Personal identity can be impaired in late-stage Alzheimer's disease and in other neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the self is distinguishable from \"others\". Including the distinction between sameness and otherness, the self versus other is a research topic in contemporary philosophy and contemporary phenomenology (see also psychological phenomenology), psychology, psychiatry, neurology, and neuroscience.\nAlthough subjective experience is central to selfhood, the privacy of this experience is only one of many problems in the Philosophy of self and scientific study of consciousness.",

Small chains serving as jewellery are a mostly decorative analogue of such types.\nThose designed for transferring power in machines have links designed to mesh with the teeth of the sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one dimension. They are known as roller chains, though there are also non-roller chains such as block chain.Two distinct chains can be connected using a quick link, carabiner, shackle, or clevis.\nLoad can be transferred from a chain to another object by a chain stopper",

For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry, including for defining basic objects such as lines, planes and rotations. Also, functional analysis, a branch of mathematical analysis, may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions.\nLinear algebra is also used in most sciences and fields of engineering, because it allows modeling many natural phenomena, and computing efficiently with such models. For nonlinear systems, which cannot be modeled with linear algebra, it is often used for dealing with first-order approximations, using the fact that the differential of a multivariate function at a point is the linear map that best approximates the function near that point.",

Symbols allow people to go beyond what is known or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas, or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon is a common symbol for \"STOP\"; on maps, blue lines often represent rivers; and a red rose often symbolizes love and compassion. Numerals are symbols for numbers; letters of an alphabet may be symbols for certain phonemes; and personal names are symbols representing individuals. The variable 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.\nThe academic study of symbols is semiotics. In cartography, an organized collection of symbols forms a legend for a map.",

                    "Summary": "Geometry (from the Ancient Greek: γεωμετρία; geo- \"earth\", -metron \"measurement\") is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It is concerned with properties of space that are related with distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.\nUntil the 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to Euclidean geometry, which includes the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve, as fundamental concepts.During the 19th century several discoveries enlarged dramatically the scope of geometry. One of the oldest such discoveries is Gauss' Theorema Egregium (\"remarkable theorem\") that asserts roughly that the Gaussian curvature of a surface is independent from any specific embedding in a Euclidean space. This implies that surfaces can be studied intrinsically, that is, as stand-alone spaces, and has been expanded into the theory of manifolds and Riemannian geometry.\nLater in the 19th century, it appeared that geometries without the parallel postulate (non-Euclidean geometries) can be developed without introducing any contradiction. The geometry that underlies general relativity is a famous application of non-Euclidean geometry.\nSince then, the scope of geometry has been greatly expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that depend on the underlying methods—differential geometry, algebraic geometry, computational geometry, algebraic topology, discrete geometry (also known as combinatorial geometry), etc.—or on the properties of Euclidean spaces that are disregarded—projective geometry that consider only alignment of points but not distance and parallelism, affine geometry that omits the concept of angle and distance, finite geometry that omits continuity, and others.\nOriginally developed to model the physical world, geometry has applications in almost all sciences, and also in art, architecture, and other activities that are related to graphics. Geometry also has applications in areas of mathematics that are apparently unrelated. For example, methods of algebraic geometry are fundamental in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that was stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, and remained unsolved for several centuries.",

            "transcript": "Other direction, so we have the boundary. Now we have the co boundary. The co boundary of an oriented case simplex, is the collection of all oriented k, plus one simplices that contain sigma and which have the same relative orientation again, maybe made clear by an example. Let's say we have this vertex v inside of this triangle, mesh oriented triangle mesh, then the co boundary of this vertex is all of the edges that point toward the vertex v question. Why do they point in? How did I decide that they should all point toward the vertex and not away? Well? This just goes back to the definition of relative orientation. Right, for instance, e1 is the center vertex minus the vertex at the top, so for them to have the same relative orientation, I need to pick the edge such that the head is positive and the tail is negative. Okay, another example. Let's say I have the edge e. What is the co boundary of the edge e? Well, let's look at the definition again right. It's all oriented k, plus one simplices, so all oriented triangles that contain sigma in this case that contain the edge and which have the same relative orientation. So what we should see is the two edges, sorry, the two triangles touching e and which have actually opposite orientations right, sigma, one and sigma two are kind of pointing in different directions, but they share the same orientation with the edge e. By the way, this operation might remind you of something we had for ordinary simplicial complexes, non-oriented simplicial complexes. What would that be? So we had this idea of the simplicial star right. The star of a ordinary simplex is the collection of all simplices containing that simplex. So this is kind of a similar idea. The co-boundary operator is a similar notion, but there are two important differences. One is that, of course, the co-boundary operator considers orientation and two the co boundary operator is only giving us simplices of one degree higher right. I'm only finding k, plus one simplices that contain sigma, whereas the star said any simplex of any degree that contains the original one. Okay. So that's our primal object, simplicial chains. What about the dual object? Well, the dual object is a simplicial cochain and just like the right way to think about co. Vectors is as linear maps from vectors to numbers. A simplicial k code chain is a linear map taking a simplicial k chain to a number. So if I have a cochain alpha and I apply it to a chain c- one sigma one plus dot dot, plus c n sigma n, then I'm gonna spit out a number. In particular, I'm gonna spit out the number that I get by just summing over all of the simplices some coefficient alpha, I associated with the I simplex, the I k, simplex times, ci the coefficient in my chain for that simplex, okay. So, for example, maybe I have a simplicial k, co-chain alpha that assigns one to every individual, two simplex right. So if I stick in a chain, that's just a single oriented triangle, no matter which one it is the linear function says. The value of the function is equal to 1.. Let's say I apply that to a chain sigma, 3, plus 3, sigma, 5, plus sigma 8. Okay, then, by linearity, I'm just going to add up 1 plus 3, plus 1., okay, or we could write this out in kind of a matrix representation right. I could encode my linear map from chains, two numbers as a row, vector in this case. That's just all ones, and I can encode my chain as a column vector that says how many copies of each simplex I have. Okay and the application of the linear map is just ordinary matrix multiplication. I take a dot product and again get one plus three plus one equal, five. Okay, if you want to be a bit more formal about this, you could say the co-chain group ck is a group of homomorphisms from k chains to the reals. If that doesn't mean anything to you, that's perfectly fine. This idea of taking linear combinations and then applying a linear map is exactly the right picture. Okay, so this is all getting pretty abstract. What does this really mean? What does it mean geometrically, so what we are going to do is do exactly what we've been doing. This whole lecture and say: okay, we're going to think of this simplistical k code chain as storing for each oriented k-simplex, the integral of some differential k-form over that simplex. That's where we get these coefficients alpha sub! I okay! If that's the case right, if the, if the simplicial code chain is storing these little integrals, then what does it mean geometrically to apply this linear map? What does it mean to apply a cochaine to a chain? Well, okay, we just said our discrete k-form values or our cochain values come from integrating some smooth k form over each case simplex. So let's say we have this simplicial 2 complex. We integrate some continuous 2 form over each triangle. In some places the 2 form lines up more with the triangle, so we get a bigger value, a darker red color. In some places the two form doesn't line up very well with a triangle, so we get a lighter value, a smaller value. Right and now let's say we have a simplicial chain that specifies some region of this mesh some union of triangles. What does it mean to apply alpha hat to c, so we say alpha hat of c. Well, that's going to be alpha: hat 3, plus alpha hat 4, plus half a hat 7, plus alpha hat 8 right, because all of our coefficients in c are just ones, so we just add up the corresponding values of alpha. What does that mean? Geometrically? It means oh well, that's the same as integrating our original continuous differential form alpha over the union of those triangles okay. So this is a lot of words and and concepts and ideas to just say. Oh if we were to integrate a differential form over each of these little triangles, then sure if we need the integral over a bigger region, we can just go ahead and add up those little integrals and we get the exact result right: we're not making any kind of approximation. There's no error. Okay! So that's good! It's good to have that interpretation. It kind of grounds us in some connection to differential forms, but it's also useful to take a step back.",

So if I have a coaching alpha and I apply it to a chain c- one sigma one plus dot dot, plus c n sigma n, then I was gonna spit out a number. In particular, I was gonna spit out the number that I get by just summing over all of the simplex some coefficient alpha, I associated with the I simplex, the I k, simplex times, ci the coefficient in my chain for that simplex, okay. So, for example, maybe I have a simplicial k, co-chain alpha that assigns one to every individual, two simplex right. So if I stick with a chain, that's just a single oriented triangle, no matter which one it is the linear function says. The value of the function is equal to 1.. Let's say I apply that to a chain sigma, 3, plus 3, sigma, 5, plus sigma 8. Okay, then, by linearity, I'm just going to add up 1 plus 3, plus 1., okay, or we could write this out in a kind of a matrix representation right. I could encode my linear map from chains, two numbers as a row, vector in this case. That's just all ones, and I can encode my chain as a column vector that says how many copies of each simplex I have. Okay and the application of the linear map is just ordinary matrix multiplication. I take a dot product and again get one plus three plus one equal, five. Okay, if you want to be a bit more formal about this, you could say the co-chain group cook is a group of homomorphisms from k chains to the reals. If that doesn't mean anything to you, that's perfectly fine. This idea of taking linear combinations and then applying a linear map is exactly the right picture. Okay, so this is all getting pretty abstract. What does this really mean? What does it mean geometrically, so what we are going to do is do exactly what we've been doing. This whole lecture and say: okay, we're going to think of this simplistic k code chain as storing for each oriented k-simplex, the integral of some differential k-form over that simplex. That's where we get these coefficients alpha sub! I okay! If that's the case right, if the, if the simplicial cold chain is storing these little integrals, then what does it mean geometrically to apply this linear map? What does it mean to apply a coaching to a chain? Well, okay, we just said our discrete k-form values or our coaching values come from integrating some smooth k form over each case simplex. So let's say we have this simplicial 2 complex. We integrate some continuous 2 form over each triangle. In some places the 2 form lines up more with the triangle, so we get a bigger value, a darker red color. In some places the two form doesn't line up very well with a triangle, so we get a lighter value, a smaller value. Right and now let's say we have a simplicial chain that specifies some region of this mesh some union of triangles. What does it mean to apply alpha hat to see, so we say alpha hat of c. Well, that's going to be alpha: hat 3, plus alpha hat 4, plus half a hat 7, plus alpha hat 8 right, because all of our coefficients in care just ones, so we just add up the corresponding values of alpha. What does that mean? Geometrically? It means oh well, that's the same as integrating our original continuous differential form alpha over the union of those triangles okay. So this is a lot of words and concepts and ideas to just say. Oh, if we were to integrate a different form over each of these little triangles, then sure, if we need the integral over a bigger region, we can just go ahead and add up those little integrals and we get the exact result right: we're not making any kind of approximation. There's no error. Okay! So that's good! It's good to have that interpretation. It kind of grounds us in some connection to different forms, but it's also useful to take a step back.",

                    "Summary": "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, and more specifically in linear algebra, a linear map (also called a linear mapping, linear transformation, vector space homomorphism, or in some contexts linear function) is a mapping \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        →\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V\\to W}\n   between two  vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. The same names and the same definition are also used for the more general case of modules over a ring; see Module homomorphism.\nIf a linear map is a bijection then it is called a linear isomorphism. In the case where \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V=W}\n  , a linear map is called a (linear) endomorphism. Sometimes the term linear operator refers to this case, but the term \"linear operator\" can have different meanings for different conventions: for example, it can be used to emphasize that \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W}\n   are real vector spaces (not necessarily with \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V=W}\n  ), or it can be used to emphasize that \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n   is a function space, which is a common convention in functional analysis. Sometimes the term linear function has the same meaning as linear map, while in analysis it does not.\nA linear map from V  to W always maps the origin of V  to the origin of W. Moreover, it maps  linear subspaces in V onto linear subspaces in W (possibly of a lower dimension); for example, it maps a plane through the origin in V to either a plane through the origin in W, a line through the origin in W, or just the origin in W. Linear maps can often be represented as matrices, and simple examples include rotation and reflection linear transformations.\nIn the language of category theory, linear maps are the morphisms of vector spaces.",

                    "Summary": "A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes.\nMany maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive. Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or fictional, without regard to context or scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping. The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables.\nAlthough the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word \"map\" comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world. Thus, \"map\" became a shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.\n\n",

Linearity is closely related to proportionality. Examples in physics include rectilinear motion, the linear relationship of voltage and current in an electrical conductor (Ohm's law), and the relationship of mass and weight. By contrast, more complicated relationships are nonlinear.\nGeneralized for functions in more than one dimension, linearity means the property of a function of being compatible with addition and scaling, also known as the superposition principle. \nThe word linear comes from Latin linearis, \"pertaining to or resembling a line\".\n\n",

                    "Summary": "Red is the color at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet. It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and a secondary color (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces.: 60–61  In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. Red became a symbolic color of communism; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, later followed by China, Vietnam, and other communist countries.\nSince red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage. Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy. In China, India and many other Asian countries it is the color symbolizing happiness and good fortune.: 39–63 ",

When variables appear in the coefficients, they are often called parameters, and must be clearly distinguished from those representing other variables in an expression.  \nFor example, \n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        −\n        x\n        +\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2x^{2}-x+3}\n  ,  has the real coefficients 2, -1, and 3 respectively, and \n\n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        b\n        x\n        +\n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c}\n  ,  has coefficient parameters a, b, and c respectively assuming x is the variable of the equation.  \nThe constant coefficient is the coefficient not attached to variables in an expression. For example, the constant coefficients of the expressions above are the real coefficient 3 and the parameter represented by c. \nSimilarly, the coefficient attached to the highest multiplicity of the variable in a polynomial is referred to as the leading coefficient. For example in the expressions above, the leading coefficients are 2 and the parameter represented by a.\nThe binomial coefficients occur in the expanded form of \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        +\n        y\n        \n          )\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x+y)^{n}}\n  , and are tabulated in Pascal's triangle.\n\n",

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

It is only a partial generalization, based upon the categorical properties of duality for finite-dimensional vector spaces. An object admitting a dual is called a dualizable object. In this formalism, infinite-dimensional vector spaces are not dualizable, since the dual vector space V∗ doesn't satisfy the axioms. Often, an object is dualizable only when it satisfies some finiteness or compactness property.A category in which each object has a dual is called autonomous or rigid. The category of finite-dimensional vector spaces with the standard tensor product is rigid, while the category of all vector spaces is not. \n\n",

Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size. \nHeads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization. In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissues concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing. Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head.\n\n",

                    "Summary": "A chain is a serial assembly of connected pieces, called links, typically made of metal, with an overall character similar to that of a rope in that it is flexible and curved in compression but linear, rigid, and load-bearing in tension. A chain may consist of two or more links. Chains can be classified by their design, which can be dictated by their use: \n\nThose designed for lifting, such as when used with a hoist; for pulling; or for securing, such as with a bicycle lock, have links that are torus shaped, which make the chain flexible in two dimensions (the fixed third dimension being a chain's length). Small chains serving as jewellery are a mostly decorative analogue of such types.\nThose designed for transferring power in machines have links designed to mesh with the teeth of the sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one dimension. They are known as roller chains, though there are also non-roller chains such as block chain.Two distinct chains can be connected using a quick link, carabiner, shackle, or clevis.\nLoad can be transferred from a chain to another object by a chain stopper",

It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.\nNevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.Time in physics is operationally defined as \"what a clock reads\".The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in space-time. Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship. Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates). However, the numerical values are different for different observers. In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer. Distance and time are intimately related and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley. General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds. At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities. The SI base unit of time is the second. Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted.\nThe operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is. It does not address why events can happen forward and backward in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum. General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes.\nTemporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms (see below). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (\"time is money\") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans.\nThere are many systems for determining what time it is, including the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time. In general, the numbers obtained from different time systems differ from one another.",

                    "Summary": "In linguistics, a word of a spoken language can be defined as the smallest sequence of phonemes that can be uttered in isolation with objective or practical meaning. In many languages, words also correspond to sequences of graphemes (\"letters\") in their standard writing systems that are delimited by spaces wider than the normal inter-letter space, or by other graphical conventions. The concept of \"word\" is usually distinguished from that of a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of word which has a meaning, even if it will not stand on its own together or in other small words.\nIn many languages, the notion of what constitutes a \"word\" may be learned as part of learning the writing system. This is the case for the English language, and for most languages that are written with alphabets derived from the ancient Latin or Greek alphabets.\nThere still remains no consensus among linguists about the proper definition of \"word\" in a spoken language that is independent of its writing system, nor about the precise distinction between it and \"morpheme\".  This issue is particularly debated for Chinese and other languages of East Asia, and may be moot for Afro-Asiatic languages.\nIn English orthography, the letter sequences \"rock\", \"god\", \"write\", \"with\", \"the\", \"not\" are considered to be single-morpheme words, whereas \"rocks\", \"ungodliness\", \"typewriter\", and \"cannot\" are words composed of two or more morphemes (\"rock\"+\"s\", \"un\"+\"god\"+\"li\"+\"ness\", \"type\"+\"writ\"+\"er\", and \"can\"+\"not\"). In English and many other languages, the morphemes that make up a word generally include at least one root (such as \"rock\", \"god\", \"type\", \"writ\", \"can\", \"not\") and possibly some affixes (\"-s\", \"un-\", \"-ly\", \"-ness\"). Words with more than one root (\"[type][writ]er\", \"[cow][boy]s\", \"[tele][graph]ically\") are called compound words.\nWords are combined to form other elements of language, such as phrases (\"a red rock\", \"put up with\"), clauses (\"I threw a rock\"), and sentences (\"I threw a rock, but missed\").",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, matrix multiplication is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices. For matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix, known as the matrix product, has the number of rows of the first and the number of columns of the second matrix. The product of matrices A and B is denoted as AB.Matrix multiplication was first described by the French mathematician Jacques Philippe Marie Binet in 1812, to represent the composition of linear maps that are represented by matrices. Matrix multiplication is thus a basic tool of linear algebra, and as such has numerous applications in many areas of mathematics, as well as in applied mathematics, statistics, physics, economics, and engineering.\nComputing matrix products is a central operation in all computational applications of linear algebra.",

Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.\nRights are fundamental to any civilization and the history of social conflicts is often bound up with attempts both to define and to redefine them. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\".",

Fortran uses \"Column Major\", in which all the elements for a given column are stored contiguously in memory. C uses \"Row Major\", which stores all the elements for a given row contiguously in memory.\nLAPACK defines various matrix representations in memory. There is also Sparse matrix representation  and Morton-order matrix representation.\nAccording to the documentation, in LAPACK the unitary matrix representation is optimized.  Some languages such as Java store matrices using Iliffe vectors. These are particularly useful for storing irregular matrices. Matrices are of primary importance in linear algebra.\n\n",

                    "Summary": "A lecture (from the Greek lecture, meaning reading) is an oral presentation intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a business person’s sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture.  Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content.\nThough lectures are much criticised as a teaching method, universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses.  Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of communication that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon passive learning.  Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning. Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in academia as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.\nLectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on \"keynote addresses\", i.e., lectures. The public lecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements. Union halls, for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. Similarly, churches, community centers, libraries, museums, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. Lectures represent a continuation of oral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. Lectures may be considered a type of grey literature.",

                    "Summary": "Concepts are defined as ordinary ideas or general notions that occur in the mind, in speech, or in thought. They are understood to be the fundamental building blocks of the concept behind principles, thoughts and beliefs.\nThey play an important role in all aspects of cognition. As such, concepts are studied by several disciplines, such as linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, and these disciplines are interested in the logical and psychological structure of concepts, and how they are put together to form thoughts and sentences. The study of concepts has served as an important flagship of an emerging interdisciplinary approach called cognitive science.In contemporary philosophy, there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:\nConcepts as mental representations, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)\nConcepts as abilities, where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)\nConcepts as Fregean senses (see sense and reference), where concepts are abstract objects, as opposed to mental objects and mental statesConcepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed \"superordinate\" and lower levels termed \"subordinate\". Additionally, there is the \"basic\" or \"middle\" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept. For example, a basic-level concept would be \"chair\", with its superordinate, \"furniture\", and its subordinate, \"easy chair\".\n\nConcepts may be exact, or inexact.\nWhen the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of tree, it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking.\nA concept is instantiated (reified) by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other ideas. \nConcepts are studied as components of human cognition in the cognitive science disciplines of linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in mathematics, computer science, databases and artificial intelligence where they are sometimes called classes, schema or categories. In informal use the word concept often just means any idea.",

For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. More formally, a k-combination of a set S is a subset of k distinct elements of S. So, two combinations are identical if and only if each combination has the same members. (The arrangement of the members in each set does not matter.)

To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms k-selection, k-multiset, or k-combination with repetition are often used. If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears.\nAlthough the set of three fruits was small enough to write a complete list of combinations, this becomes impractical as the size of the set increases. For example, a poker hand can be described as a 5-combination (k = 5) of cards from a 52 card deck (n = 52). The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is 1 / 2,598,960.",

It comprises a set of triangles (typically in three dimensions) that are connected by their common edges or corners.\nMany graphics software packages and hardware devices can operate more efficiently on triangles that are grouped into meshes than on a similar number of triangles that are presented individually.  This is typically because computer graphics do operations on the vertices at the corners of triangles.  With individual triangles, the system has to operate on three vertices for every triangle.  In a large mesh, there could be eight or more triangles meeting at a single vertex - by processing those vertices just once, it is possible to do a fraction of the work and achieve an identical effect.\nIn many computer graphics applications it is necessary to manage a mesh of triangles. The mesh components are vertices, edges, and triangles. An application might require knowledge of the various connections between the mesh components. These connections can be managed independently of the actual vertex positions. This document describes a simple data structure that is convenient for managing the connections. This is not the only possible data structure. Many other types exist and have support for various queries about meshes.",

In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support (the shaft of the column) with a capital and a base or pedestal, which is made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. \nFor the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed \"columns\" because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, \"column\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are engaged, that is to say form part of a wall. A long sequence of columns joined by an entablature is known as a colonnade.",

Questions can thus be understood as a kind of illocutionary act in the field of pragmatics or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics. Questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered.",

A regular k-simplex may be constructed from a regular (k − 1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length.\nThe standard simplex or probability simplex  is the k - 1 dimensional simplex whose vertices are the k standard unit vectors, or\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          {\n          \n            x\n            ∈\n            \n              \n                R\n              \n              \n                k\n              \n            \n            :\n            \n              x\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n            +\n            ⋯\n            +\n            \n              x\n              \n                k\n                −\n                1\n              \n            \n            =\n            1\n            ,\n            \n              x\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            ≥\n            0\n            \n               for \n            \n            i\n            =\n            0\n            ,\n            …\n            ,\n            k\n            −\n            1\n          \n          }\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left\\{x\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{k}:x_{0}+\\dots +x_{k-1}=1,x_{i}\\geq 0{\\text{ for }}i=0,\\dots ,k-1\\right\\}.}\n  In topology and combinatorics, it is common to “glue together” simplices to form a simplicial complex.  The associated combinatorial structure is called an abstract simplicial complex, in which context the word “simplex” simply means any finite set of vertices.",

                    "Summary": "In common usage and in philosophy, ideas are abstract concepts. Also in philosophy, ideas can also be mental representational images of some object. Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being. The capacity to create and understand the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of human beings. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious reflection, for example, when we talk about the idea of a person or a place. A new or an original idea can often lead to innovation.",

                    "Summary": "In algebra, a homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces). The word homomorphism comes from the Ancient Greek language: ὁμός (homos) meaning \"same\" and μορφή (morphe) meaning \"form\" or \"shape\". However, the word was apparently introduced to mathematics due to a (mis)translation of German ähnlich meaning \"similar\" to ὁμός meaning \"same\". The term \"homomorphism\" appeared as early as 1892, when it was attributed to the German mathematician Felix Klein (1849–1925).Homomorphisms of vector spaces are also called linear maps, and their study is the object of linear algebra.\nThe concept of homomorphism has been generalized, under the name of morphism, to many other structures that either do not have an underlying set, or are not algebraic. This generalization is the starting point of category theory.\nA homomorphism may also be an isomorphism, an endomorphism, an automorphism, etc. (see below). Each of those can be defined in a way that may be generalized to any class of morphisms.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, an integral assigns numbers to functions in a way that describes displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data. The process of finding integrals is called integration. Along with differentiation, integration is a fundamental, essential operation of calculus, and serves as a tool to solve problems in mathematics and physics involving the area of an arbitrary shape, the length of a curve, and the volume of a solid, among others.\nThe integrals enumerated here are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function. In this case, they are called indefinite integrals. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known.\nAlthough methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs.\nIntegrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed. For example, a line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting the two endpoints of the interval. In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in three-dimensional space.",

That's really all it is okay and as we go on, we might by the way to note the space of discrete differential k forms as capital omega hat sub k. Okay, so so far we've been talking about the first direction, discretization going from something continuous to something discrete, let's go the other direction. Let's say we have discrete data on our mesh and we want to construct some continuous differential form, the most straightforward reason, by the way that you would want to do this is to say, oh, I have like values and vertices and I want to visualize them or I have values on edges and I want to visualize them. How are you going to draw this on your screen? Well, you have to interpolate them. Somehow, okay, so how does that work? Let's start at the beginning, so let's say we have a discrete differential, zero form, which is a really really fancy way of saying at every vertex of our mesh. We have a number right: how can we interpolate these numbers or these values across the rest of the mesh? Well, one way is to use the so-called hat functions or lagrange bases the lagrange basis phi sub, I associated with vertex. I is a function that is linear over each simplex and satisfies this property, so just meaning that at each vertex j the function takes a value one if j is actually the same as vertex I and zero, otherwise, so a function that looks like this. Okay, that's why we call it a hat function, because it looks like this really cool hat okay. So then, once we have a basis function associated with a single vertex, we can take linear combinations of these basis functions to do interpolation, okay, so in particular let's say we have a discrete zero form. We have a value at every vertex. Then we can interpolate these values with a function. U of x, which is just the sover, all vertices I of the value? U sub I stored at I times the hat function phi sub I associated with that vertex, so we just weight the hat functions by the values at vertices. If a value u sub, I gets bigger, then that hat function gets taller if it gets smaller. That hat function gets shorter right and we say that this function: u of x, interpolates the data, the? U sub I's, because we know by the way we constructed these bases that at the vertex, this function is going to exactly hit the value. U sub, I okay! So the result by the way this object? U of x, is a continuous object. It's a object that has a value at every point x in the entire domain, so we've now gone from a discrete zero form to a continuous zero form.

We have a value at every vertex. Then we can interpolate these values with a function. U of x, which is just the cover, all vertices I of the value? U sub I stored at I times the hat function phi sub I associated with that vertex, so we just weight the hat functions by the values at the vertices. If a value u, sub, I get bigger, then that hat function gets taller if it gets smaller. That hat function gets shorter right and we say that this function: u  x, interpolates the data, the? U sub I's, because we know by the way we constructed these bases that at the vertex, this function is going to exactly hit the value. U sub, I okay! So the result of the way this object? U of x, is a continuous object. It's an object that has a value at every point x in the entire domain, so we've now gone from a discrete zero form to a continuous zero form. These hat functions are connected to the.",

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, interpolation is a type of estimation, a method of constructing (finding) new data points based on the range of a discrete set of known data points.In engineering and science, one often has a number of data points, obtained by sampling or experimentation, which represent the values of a function for a limited number of values of the independent variable. It is often required to interpolate; that is, estimate the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable.\nA closely related problem is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function. Suppose the formula for some given function is known, but too complicated to evaluate efficiently. A few data points from the original function can be interpolated to produce a simpler function which is still fairly close to the original. The resulting gain in simplicity may outweigh the loss from interpolation error and give better performance in calculation process.",

These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly  devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a  Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for counting (or measuring) a distance travelled by transportation devices in use in ancient Rome, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.",

                    "Summary": "Property is a system of rights that gives people legal control of valuable things, and also refers to the valuable things themselves.  Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property may have the right to consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a durable, mean or factor, or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it.\nIn economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: private property, public property, and collective property (also called cooperative property). Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally. However, there is an expectation that each party's will (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional, so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent. The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous, or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute. The Restatement (First) of Property defines property as anything, tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing. This mediating relationship between individual, property and state is called a property regime.In sociology and anthropology, property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object. The distinction between \"collective property\" and \"private property\" is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.Types of property include real property (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land), personal property (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (state owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and intellectual property (exclusive rights over artistic creations, inventions, etc.), although the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced. An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts. A title, or a right of ownership, establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit. The unqualified term \"property\" is often used to refer specifically to real property.",

This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers. Dichotomization is the special case of discretization in which the number of discrete classes is 2, which can approximate a continuous variable as a binary variable (creating a dichotomy for modeling purposes, as in binary classification).\nDiscretization is also related to discrete mathematics, and is an important component of granular computing.  In this context, discretization may also refer to modification of variable or category granularity, as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.\nWhenever continuous data is discretized, there is always some amount of discretization error. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered negligible for the modeling purposes at hand.\n The terms discretization  and quantization often have the same denotation but not always identical connotations. (Specifically, the two terms share a semantic field.) The same is true of discretization error and quantization error.\nMathematical methods relating to discretization include the Euler–Maruyama method and the zero-order hold.",

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

Every function in the function space can be represented as a linear combination of basis functions, just as every vector in a vector space can be represented as a linear combination of basis vectors.\nIn numerical analysis and approximation theory, basis functions are also called blending functions, because of their use in interpolation: In this application, a mixture of the basis functions provides an interpolating function (with the \"blend\" depending on the evaluation of the basis functions at the data points).\n\n",

                    "Summary": "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.\nNevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.Time in physics is operationally defined as \"what a clock reads\".The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in space-time. Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship. Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates). However, the numerical values are different for different observers. In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer. Distance and time are intimately related and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley. General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds. At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities. The SI base unit of time is the second. Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted.\nThe operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is. It does not address why events can happen forward and backward in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum. General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes.\nTemporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms (see below). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (\"time is money\") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans.\nThere are many systems for determining what time it is, including the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time. In general, the numbers obtained from different time systems differ from one another.",

For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. More formally, a k-combination of a set S is a subset of k distinct elements of S. So, two combinations are identical if and only if each combination has the same members. (The arrangement of the members in each set does not matter.) If the set has n elements, the number of k-combinations, denoted as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            k\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{k}^{n}}\n  , is equal to the binomial coefficient\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              (\n            \n            \n              n\n              k\n            \n            \n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              (\n              n\n              −\n              1\n              )\n              ⋯\n              (\n              n\n              −\n              k\n              +\n              1\n              )\n            \n            \n              k\n              (\n              k\n              −\n              1\n              )\n              ⋯\n              1\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\binom {n}{k}}={\\frac {n(n-1)\\dotsb (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\\dotsb 1}},}\n  which can be written using factorials as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                n\n                !\n              \n              \n                k\n                !\n                (\n                n\n                −\n                k\n                )\n                !\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}}\n   whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        ≤\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k\\leq n}\n  , and which is zero when \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        >\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k>n}\n  .

The set of all k-combinations of a set S is often denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                (\n              \n              \n                S\n                k\n              \n              \n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\binom {S}{k}}}\n  .\nA combination is a combination of n things taken k at a time without repetition. To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms k-selection, k-multiset, or k-combination with repetition are often used. If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears.\nAlthough the set of three fruits was small enough to write a complete list of combinations, this becomes impractical as the size of the set increases. For example, a poker hand can be described as a 5-combination (k = 5) of cards from a 52 card deck (n = 52). The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is 1 / 2,598,960.",

It is often required to interpolate; that is, estimate the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable.\nA closely related problem is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function. Suppose the formula for some given function is known, but too complicated to evaluate efficiently. A few data points from the original function can be interpolated to produce a simpler function which is still fairly close to the original. The resulting gain in simplicity may outweigh the loss from interpolation error and give better performance in calculation process.",

If the set has n elements, the number of k-combinations, denoted as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            k\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{k}^{n}}\n  , is equal to the binomial coefficient\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              (\n            \n            \n              n\n              k\n            \n            \n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              (\n              n\n              −\n              1\n              )\n              ⋯\n              (\n              n\n              −\n              k\n              +\n              1\n              )\n            \n            \n              k\n              (\n              k\n              −\n              1\n              )\n              ⋯\n              1\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\binom {n}{k}}={\\frac {n(n-1)\\dotsb (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\\dotsb 1}},}\n  which can be written using factorials as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                n\n                !\n              \n              \n                k\n                !\n                (\n                n\n                −\n                k\n                )\n                !\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}}}\n   whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        ≤\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k\\leq n}\n  , and which is zero when \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        >\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k>n}\n  .

The set of all k-combinations of a set S is often denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                (\n              \n              \n                S\n                k\n              \n              \n                )\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\binom {S}{k}}}\n  .\nA combination is a combination of n things taken k at a time without repetition. To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms k-selection, k-multiset, or k-combination with repetition are often used. If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears.\nAlthough the set of three fruits was small enough to write a complete list of combinations, this becomes impractical as the size of the set increases. For example, a poker hand can be described as a 5-combination (k = 5) of cards from a 52 card deck (n = 52). The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is 1 / 2,598,960.",

                    "Summary": "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

                    "Summary": "On a differentiable manifold, the exterior derivative extends the concept of the differential of a function to differential forms of higher degree. The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by Élie Cartan in 1899. It allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of Stokes' theorem, Gauss's theorem, and Green's theorem from vector calculus.\nIf a differential k-form is thought of as measuring the flux through an infinitesimal k-parallelotope at each point of the manifold, then its exterior derivative can be thought of as measuring the net flux through the boundary of a (k + 1)-parallelotope at each point.",

                    "Summary": "Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.\nNevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.Time in physics is operationally defined as \"what a clock reads\".The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in space-time. Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship. Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates). However, the numerical values are different for different observers. In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer. Distance and time are intimately related and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley. General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds. At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities. The SI base unit of time is the second. Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted.\nThe operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is. It does not address why events can happen forward and backward in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum. General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes.\nTemporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms (see below). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (\"time is money\") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans.\nThere are many systems for determining what time it is, including the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time. In general, the numbers obtained from different time systems differ from one another.",

Questions can thus be understood as a kind of illocutionary act in the field of pragmatics or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics. Questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered.",

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers.

In this context, discretization may also refer to modification of variable or category granularity, as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.\nWhenever continuous data is discretized, there is always some amount of discretization error. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered negligible for the modeling purposes at hand.\n The terms discretization  and quantization often have the same denotation but not always identical connotations.

                    "Summary": "A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes.\nMany maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive. Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or fictional, without regard to context or scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping. The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables.\nAlthough the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word \"map\" comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world. Thus, \"map\" became a shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.\n\n",

                    "Summary": "Property is a system of rights that gives people legal control of valuable things, and also refers to the valuable things themselves.  Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property may have the right to consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a durable, mean or factor, or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it.\nIn economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: private property, public property, and collective property (also called cooperative property). Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally. However, there is an expectation that each party's will (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional, so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent. The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous, or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute. The Restatement (First) of Property defines property as anything, tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing. This mediating relationship between individual, property and state is called a property regime.In sociology and anthropology, property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object. The distinction between \"collective property\" and \"private property\" is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.Types of property include real property (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land), personal property (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (state owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and intellectual property (exclusive rights over artistic creations, inventions, etc.), although the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced. An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts. A title, or a right of ownership, establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit. The unqualified term \"property\" is often used to refer specifically to real property.",

                    "Summary": "In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Élie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

                    "Summary": "In mathematics, an integral assigns numbers to functions in a way that describes displacement, area, volume, and other concepts that arise by combining infinitesimal data. The process of finding integrals is called integration. Along with differentiation, integration is a fundamental, essential operation of calculus, and serves as a tool to solve problems in mathematics and physics involving the area of an arbitrary shape, the length of a curve, and the volume of a solid, among others.\nThe integrals enumerated here are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function. In this case, they are called indefinite integrals. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known.\nAlthough methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs.\nIntegrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed. For example, a line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting the two endpoints of the interval. In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in three-dimensional space.",

                    "Summary": "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

Questions can thus be understood as a kind of illocutionary act in the field of pragmatics or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics. Questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered.",

It's not always what actually happens in practice, but that's the right conceptual picture. We can also go the other direction. If we have values stored on our mesh, we can interpolate them to get a continuous differential form and we did that by taking weighted sums of basis functions in particular, the whitney basis functions. Okay, so again in practice, these discrete differential forms almost never come from direct integration. More typically, we're going to start out with some values at vertices, like samples of a function or positions of the vertices of our mesh, and these higher degree forms are going to arise from applying operators like the discrete exterior derivative or the discrete hot star, which are going to be the topic of our next lecture.

It is often required to interpolate; that is, estimate the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable.\nA closely related problem is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function. Suppose the formula for some given function is known, but too complicated to evaluate efficiently. A few data points from the original function can be interpolated to produce a simpler function which is still fairly close to the original. The resulting gain in simplicity may outweigh the loss from interpolation error and give better performance in calculation process.",

This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers. Dichotomization is the special case of discretization in which the number of discrete classes is 2, which can approximate a continuous variable as a binary variable (creating a dichotomy for modeling purposes, as in binary classification).\nDiscretization is also related to discrete mathematics, and is an important component of granular computing.  In this context, discretization may also refer to modification of variable or category granularity, as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.\nWhenever continuous data is discretized, there is always some amount of discretization error. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered negligible for the modeling purposes at hand.\n The terms discretization  and quantization often have the same denotation but not always identical connotations. (Specifically, the two terms share a semantic field.) The same is true of discretization error and quantization error.\nMathematical methods relating to discretization include the Euler–Maruyama method and the zero-order hold.",

It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.\nFor instance, the expression f(x) dx from one-variable calculus is an example of a 1-form, and can be integrated over an oriented interval [a, b] in the domain of f:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            a\n          \n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\\,dx.}\n  Similarly, the expression f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy + g(x, y, z) dz ∧ dx + h(x, y, z) dy ∧ dz is a 2-form that has a surface integral over an oriented surface S:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∫\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        x\n        ∧\n        d\n        y\n        +\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        z\n        ∧\n        d\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        ,\n        z\n        )\n        \n        d\n        y\n        ∧\n        d\n        z\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int _{S}(f(x,y,z)\\,dx\\wedge dy+g(x,y,z)\\,dz\\wedge dx+h(x,y,z)\\,dy\\wedge dz).}\n  The symbol ∧ denotes the exterior product, sometimes called the wedge product, of two differential forms. Likewise, a 3-form f(x, y, z) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz represents a volume element that can be integrated over an oriented region of space. In general, a k-form is an object that may be integrated over a k-dimensional oriented manifold, and is homogeneous of degree k in the coordinate differentials.\nOn an n-dimensional manifold, the top-dimensional form (n-form) is called a volume form.\nThe algebra of differential forms is organized in a way that naturally reflects the orientation of the domain of integration.  There is an operation d on differential forms known as the exterior derivative that, when given a k-form as input, produces a (k + 1)-form as output. This operation extends the differential of a function, and is directly related to the divergence and the curl of a vector field in a manner that makes the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem special cases of the same general result, known in this context also as the generalized Stokes theorem.  In a deeper way, this theorem relates the topology of the domain of integration to the structure of the differential forms themselves; the precise connection is known as de Rham's theorem.\nThe general setting for the study of differential forms is on a differentiable manifold.  Differential 1-forms are naturally dual to vector fields on a manifold, and the pairing between vector fields and 1-forms is extended to arbitrary differential forms by the interior product.  The algebra of differential forms along with the exterior derivative defined on it is preserved by the pullback under smooth functions between two manifolds.  This feature allows geometrically invariant information to be moved from one space to another via the pullback, provided that the information is expressed in terms of differential forms.  As an example, the change of variables formula for integration becomes a simple statement that an integral is preserved under pullback.",

                    "Summary": "A lecture (from the Greek lecture, meaning reading) is an oral presentation intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a business person’s sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture.  Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content.\nThough lectures are much criticised as a teaching method, universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses.  Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of communication that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon passive learning.  Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning. Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in academia as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.\nLectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on \"keynote addresses\", i.e., lectures. The public lecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements. Union halls, for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. Similarly, churches, community centers, libraries, museums, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. Lectures represent a continuation of oral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. Lectures may be considered a type of grey literature.",

The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by Élie Cartan in 1899. It allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of Stokes' theorem, Gauss's theorem, and Green's theorem from vector calculus.\nIf a differential k-form is thought of as measuring the flux through an infinitesimal k-parallelotope at each point of the manifold, then its exterior derivative can be thought of as measuring the net flux through the boundary of a (k + 1)-parallelotope at each point.",

                    "Summary": "A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\right)}\n  , real numbers such as the square root of 2 \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left({\\sqrt {2}}\\right)}\n   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.",

A regular k-simplex may be constructed from a regular (k − 1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length.\nThe standard simplex or probability simplex  is the k - 1 dimensional simplex whose vertices are the k standard unit vectors, or\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          {\n          \n            x\n            ∈\n            \n              \n                R\n              \n              \n                k\n              \n            \n            :\n            \n              x\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n            +\n            ⋯\n            +\n            \n              x\n              \n                k\n                −\n                1\n              \n            \n            =\n            1\n            ,\n            \n              x\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n            ≥\n            0\n            \n               for \n            \n            i\n            =\n            0\n            ,\n            …\n            ,\n            k\n            −\n            1\n          \n          }\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left\\{x\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{k}:x_{0}+\\dots +x_{k-1}=1,x_{i}\\geq 0{\\text{ for }}i=0,\\dots ,k-1\\right\\}.}\n  In topology and combinatorics, it is common to “glue together” simplices to form a simplicial complex.  The associated combinatorial structure is called an abstract simplicial complex, in which context the word “simplex” simply means any finite set of vertices.",
